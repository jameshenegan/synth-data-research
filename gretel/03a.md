## Question

What can you tell me about the methods this company uses to generate synthetic data off of tabular data?

## Response

Gretel.ai offers several sophisticated methods for generating synthetic data from tabular data:

## Primary Models

1. **Gretel Navigator Fine Tuning (NavFT)**: This is Gretel's primary model for generating synthetic tabular datasets. It can handle mixed column types, including numerical, categorical, free text, and event-driven fields[6].

2. **ACTGAN (Adversarial Conditional Tabular GAN)**: An adversarial model designed for tabular, structured numerical data with high column counts. It works well with datasets featuring primarily numeric data, high column counts, and highly unique categorical fields[4].

3. **Gretel Tabular DP**: A graph-based model for tabular data that provides differential privacy guarantees. It's particularly effective for datasets with primarily categorical variables and relatively low cardinality (less than 100 unique categories per variable)[3][5].

## Additional Models

4. **Gretel Amplify**: A statistical model designed for high-volume tabular data[7].

5. **Gretel LSTM**: A language model capable of handling tabular data along with time series and text data[7].

## Key Features

- **Differential Privacy**: Gretel offers differential privacy options for NavFT, Gretel GPT, and Tabular DP models, providing strong formal guarantees against the inference of sensitive information from the synthetic dataset[6].

- **Multi-modal Capabilities**: Gretel's models can handle various data types within tabular structures, including numerical, categorical, free text, and time-series data[6][7].

- **Conditional Generation**: Some models, like ACTGAN, support advanced features such as conditional data generation[4].

## Generation Process

Gretel's synthetic data generation typically involves:

1. Connecting to data sources using pre-built connectors[9].
2. Training or fine-tuning the selected model on the input data.
3. Generating synthetic data that maintains statistical properties of the original dataset.
4. Evaluating the quality and privacy of the generated data using expert-grade reports[9].

Gretel's platform allows users to chain together multiple synthetic data models and data transformations to design data that meets specific needs[9]. This flexibility enables users to generate high-quality synthetic tabular data while maintaining privacy and utility for various applications.
