## Question

Is this company able to generate synthetic data based off of tabular data?

## Response

Yes, Gretel.ai is capable of generating synthetic data based on tabular data. The company offers several models and solutions specifically designed for this purpose:

1. **Gretel Navigator Fine Tuning (NavFT)**: This is Gretel's primary model for generating synthetic tabular datasets. It can handle mixed column types, including numerical, categorical, free text, and event-driven fields[6][7].

2. **ACTGAN**: An adversarial model designed for tabular, structured numerical data with high column counts[7].

3. **Gretel Tabular DP**: A graph-based model for tabular data that provides differential privacy guarantees. It works well with datasets containing primarily categorical variables with relatively low cardinality[2][3].

4. **Gretel Amplify**: A statistical model for high-volume tabular data[7].

5. **Gretel LSTM**: A language model that can handle tabular data along with time series and text data[7].

These models allow users to create synthetic versions of their original tabular datasets while maintaining statistical properties and relationships between variables. Gretel.ai's platform provides APIs and tools to train these models on user data and generate synthetic tabular data on-demand[1].

The company emphasizes data privacy and offers options for differential privacy in their synthetic data generation process, ensuring that the generated data maintains the utility of the original while protecting sensitive information[6].
