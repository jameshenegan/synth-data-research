## Question 6

What can you tell me about privacy features offered by the company, security features offered by the company, and overall trustworthiness of the company with respect to the generation of synthetic data?

## Response

Gretel.ai offers a comprehensive set of privacy and security features for synthetic data generation, emphasizing a privacy-first approach in their solutions:

## Privacy Features

1. **Differential Privacy**:

   - Gretel implements differential privacy in several models, including Gretel Tabular DP.
   - Uses Differential Privacy Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) algorithm.
   - Allows fine-tuning of privacy parameters (epsilon values) based on sensitivity requirements[7].

2. **Privacy Filters**:

   - Similarity Filters: Prevent synthetic records from being overly similar to training data.
   - Outlier Filters: Ensure synthetic records are not outliers compared to the training dataset.
   - Configurable levels: null, auto, medium, and high[5].

3. **Overfitting Prevention**:

   - Stops model training before memorization of training data occurs.
   - Uses validation split and early stopping techniques[5].

4. **De-identification**:

   - Offers tools to replace real identifiers with fabricated ones before synthetic data generation[2].

5. **Privacy Evaluation**:
   - Provides comprehensive privacy measurements including PII Replay Detection and Privacy Attack Protection simulations[7].

## Security Features

1. **Cloud Integration**:

   - Offers deployment on major cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for secure infrastructure[4].

2. **Gretel Hybrid**:

   - Allows customers to keep sensitive data within their own cloud environment.
   - Data never leaves the customer's infrastructure during model training and synthetic data generation[4].

3. **Customizable Privacy Levels**:

   - Offers multiple levels of protection to balance privacy and data utility[2].

4. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Recommended as a best practice for ongoing privacy assurance[2].

## Trustworthiness

1. **Transparency**:

   - Provides detailed documentation and guides on their privacy techniques and model configurations[5][7].

2. **Evaluation Tools**:

   - Offers Gretel Evaluate for comprehensive synthetic data quality and privacy assessment[6].
   - Provides Data Quality Score (SQS), Data Privacy Scores, and ML Quality Scores (MQS) for each model trained[6].

3. **Regulatory Compliance**:

   - Addresses GDPR and CCPA requirements in their synthetic data approach[2].

4. **Expert-Grade Reports**:

   - Provides detailed reports on synthetic data quality and privacy[1].

5. **Open Source Components**:

   - Uses open small language models as base for some of their solutions, promoting transparency[7].

6. **Community Engagement**:
   - Maintains a Discord community for user support and engagement[6].

Overall, Gretel.ai demonstrates a strong commitment to privacy and security in synthetic data generation. Their comprehensive approach, which includes multiple privacy-preserving techniques, customizable settings, and transparent evaluation tools, suggests a high level of trustworthiness in handling sensitive data and producing privacy-protected synthetic datasets.
