## Question

Is this company able to generate synthetic data based off of unstructed data (e.g., PDF files, Word Documents)

## Response

Yes, Gretel.ai is capable of generating synthetic data based on unstructured data, including text-based formats like PDF files and Word documents. The company offers solutions specifically designed for handling unstructured text data:

1. **Gretel GPT**: This is a generative pre-trained transformer model designed for natural language text. It can be used to synthesize unstructured text data, which would include content from PDFs and Word documents[5].

2. **Gretel Navigator Fine Tuning**: This is an LLM-based AI system that supports various data types, including natural language text[5]. It can handle unstructured text data from sources like PDFs and Word documents.

Gretel.ai's platform provides features for working with unstructured text data:

- **Text Semantic Similarity**: The platform evaluates how well the synthetic text maintains the same semantic properties as the original dataset[3].
- **Text Structure Similarity**: This measures how closely the synthetic data mirrors the original data in terms of sentence structure, average words per sentence, and characters per word[3].

The company emphasizes its ability to handle various data types, including unstructured text. Their website states, "Synthesize unstructured text, think human language and chatbots"[4]. This indicates that Gretel.ai's tools are designed to work with the kind of unstructured text data typically found in PDFs and Word documents.

For users looking to generate text from specific prompts or based on unstructured data sources, Gretel.ai offers the Gretel Model Playground, which allows users to prompt Gretel GPT for text generation[3].

In summary, Gretel.ai provides robust capabilities for generating synthetic data from unstructured text sources, making it suitable for working with content from PDF files and Word documents.
