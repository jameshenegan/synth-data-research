**Gretel.ai** is a synthetic data startup founded in **2020** by **Ali Golshan**, **John Myers**, and **Alexander Watson** in **San Diego, California**. Its roots trace back to late 2019, when the founders began experimenting with open-source privacy tools and deep learning models to tackle data access and privacy challenges.

1. **Founding & Early Work**

   - Initially started as a side project focused on building **synthetic data** using differential privacy techniques.
   - Formally incorporated in early 2020 once the founders recognized broader demand for privacy-preserving data solutions.

2. **Funding & Growth**

   - Raised a **\$3.5 million seed round** in 2020 led by Greylock Partners.
   - Has secured a total of **\$65.5 million** to date, fueling product development and market expansion.
   - Rapid user adoption: by 2023, **over 75,000 developers** were reportedly using Gretel’s cloud platform.

3. **Product Evolution**

   - Began with basic privacy tools (classification, transformation, and synthetic generation).
   - Evolved to support a broad range of **machine learning** models (e.g., GPT-based text generation, tabular data GANs, differential privacy).
   - Emphasizes a **developer-friendly** experience, with APIs and quick-start guides for synthetic data generation.

4. **Key Partnerships & Clients**

   - Collaborations with **Google Cloud** and **Databricks** to integrate synthetic data workflows into their platforms.
   - Used by organizations like the **U.S. Department of Justice**, EY, and major healthcare institutions.
   - Focuses on regulated industries—healthcare, finance, and government—where **privacy** and **data security** are paramount.

5. **Mission & Current Focus**
   - Committed to solving the “data bottleneck” problem by enabling **safe, fast, and privacy-preserving** data sharing.
   - Continues to develop advanced synthetic data techniques (e.g., **differential privacy**, LLM-based generation).
   - Aims to empower developers and data teams with on-demand, high-quality synthetic data without compromising user privacy.

Overall, Gretel.ai’s history reflects a rapid rise in the synthetic data sector, underpinned by robust funding, a strong technical foundation, and a focus on developer-centric privacy solutions.
