## Intro/Context

My manager recently asked me to investigate six companies that provide solutions for generating synthetic data. This presentation does **not** aim to recommend a single vendor or approach. Instead, its primary goal is to offer an **objective overview** of the current synthetic data landscape, highlighting the key methods, use cases, and considerations.

## Relationship to Data Anonymization

**Synthetic Data as Anonymization**  
Synthetic data is one approach to data anonymization, complementing other techniques such as data masking. Some of the vendors we reviewed also offer these alternative methods.

## Not the Same as Simulated Data

Some experts classify “simulated data”—which is created entirely from scratch without referencing a real dataset—as a subset of synthetic data. Others draw a clear distinction, arguing that synthetic data should retain statistical properties from **actual** data. In this presentation, we focus on **synthetic data derived from real datasets** and exclude purely simulated data from our scope.

## The Holy Grail: What Does the Ideal Solution Look Like?

When evaluating synthetic data solutions, four key attributes often come into play:

1. **Syntactical Accuracy**  
   The generated data should be valid and realistic according to domain constraints (e.g., proper time-series ordering, valid postal codes).

2. **Privacy**  
   The method should prevent re-identification, ideally using formal privacy frameworks such as differential privacy.

3. **Statistical Accuracy**  
   Relevant distributions and correlations should align with the real dataset to the extent needed by the use case.

4. **Efficiency**  
   Algorithms must handle high-dimensional data and produce synthetic datasets at scale without excessive computational overhead.

It can be helpful to group these considerations into **fidelity, utility, and privacy**:

1. **Utility**

   - How well does synthetic data replicate real data for specific tasks (e.g., machine learning models)?
   - Often tested via “Train on Synthetic, Test on Real” (TSTR).

2. **Fidelity**

   - Measures how closely synthetic data matches the real data’s distributions and structure.
   - In some cases, preserving all correlations can risk privacy or replicate existing biases.

3. **Privacy**
   - Focuses on limiting how much information about real individuals might be inferred.
   - Higher fidelity tends to lower privacy, so solutions must balance these two.

### Challenges in Finding the Holy Grail

- **Trade-offs**: There is no single method that guarantees perfect fidelity and strong privacy in all scenarios.
- **Prioritization**: Generators must decide which correlations are most important for the intended use.
- **Partial Preservation**: Preserving “most” relationships may suffice, but requires careful assessment of what might be lost or disclosed.

## Conclusion

1. **Significant Potential**

   - **Privacy**: Well-designed synthetic data allows safe data sharing.
   - **Fairness**: Can reduce biases by balancing underrepresented groups.
   - **Data Augmentation**: Expands datasets for model training.
   - **Project Acceleration**: Enables faster prototyping and testing.

2. **Not Automatically Private**

   - Generating synthetic data does not guarantee anonymity.
   - Formal methods (e.g., differential privacy) are often needed to prevent re-identification.

3. **No Perfect Substitute for Real Data**

   - Synthetic data inevitably shifts certain features, affecting some use cases.
   - Critical or high-stakes applications typically require validation with real data.

4. **Difficulties with Outliers and Rare Events**

   - Extreme or uncommon data points are challenging to handle privately.
   - Solutions may omit them (hurting fidelity) or inadvertently expose them (hurting privacy).

5. **Challenges in Privacy Evaluation**

   - True privacy depends on how data is generated, not just on the dataset itself.
   - Over-reliance on simple checks can yield false confidence.

6. **Complexity of Black-Box Models**

   - Deep generative models can produce realistic data but are often opaque.
   - This can complicate audits or explainability for regulators or stakeholders.

7. **Beyond Privacy**
   - Synthetic data can address fairness, bias reduction, and robustness.
   - Ongoing research will clarify both benefits and risks in these domains.
