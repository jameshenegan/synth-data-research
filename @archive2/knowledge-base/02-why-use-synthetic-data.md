# Why Use Synthetic Data?

Usefulness and Benefits

Privacy Preservation: Synthetic datasets can be shared more openly because they lack personal identifiers.
Training Machine Learning Models: Labeled real data may be scarce or expensive; synthetic data can fill gaps and generate edge cases not found in real data.
System Testing: Developers use synthetic data to assess database performance, detect fraud and intrusions, or model rare events without risking confidentiality.

The text discusses the numerous benefits of synthetic data, particularly its role in enhancing data accessibility, improving machine learning (ML) models, and accelerating AI projects.

## Why Use Synthetic Data?

The text highlights three main ways synthetic data is used within machine learning:

1. **Private Data Release**

   - **Development of ML tools**: Organizations share synthetic data with potential partners or researchers so they can develop or compare machine learning models without exposing sensitive real data. The synthetic data must preserve statistical properties needed to evaluate models reliably.
   - **Software testing**: Synthetic data supports system testing and User Acceptance Testing without privacy concerns. Here, it needs to reflect realistic (but not necessarily statistically accurate) structures and formats.
   - **Deploying private ML tools**: Although one could train models entirely on private synthetic data, it often loses key statistical nuances. Typically, better results come from models trained directly on real data with privacy controls integrated into the training process rather than relying solely on synthetic data.

2. **De-biasing**

   - **Reducing or removing bias**: Synthetic data can be generated to remove historical biases in attributes such as gender or race, providing a fairer dataset for training. This can create a consistent approach to fairness across multiple models within an organization.
   - **What-if scenarios**: Synthetic data, generated from carefully defined causal models, can explore alternate realities or interventions (e.g., changing distributions or causal links) to see how the system might behave under different conditions. These techniques introduce model risk and require careful validation.

3. **Data Augmentation**
   - **Data labeling**: Industries rely on vast, accurately labeled data for deep learning models, particularly in computer vision. Synthetic data can cost-effectively supply labeled examples to bolster real datasets and improve model robustness, though privacy is often not the main concern in this specific use case.

In each of these scenarios, synthetic data must strike a balance between utility (realistic, relevant for the intended task) and any privacy or fairness objectives. The success of synthetic data depends heavily on how it is generated, validated, and integrated into broader workflows.

Key Benefits:

Facilitating Data Access & Collaboration: Synthetic data helps organizations overcome data access challenges, especially in AI implementations, while respecting privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. This type of data does not require customer consent since it’s not personally identifiable.

Strengthening ML Models: The demand for extensive training data for AI—particularly for neural networks—has led to an increase in the use of synthetic data. It provides more samples and helps address the under-representation of minority events, enhancing the learning capabilities of AI algorithms.

Augmented Data Quality: Companies often turn to public datasets for training ML models, but these typically lack diversity. Generating synthetic labeled data can speed up model development and improve accuracy during the labeling process.

Springy Exploratory Analyses: Synthetic data can be used for initial exploratory analysis, allowing data scientists to derive insights before sourcing real data, which often involves complex approval processes. This preliminary modeling can lead to more accurate outcomes when real data becomes available.

Speeding Up Product Development and Testing: Synthetic data aids in the development and testing of products, especially when real data is inaccessible. It is cost-effective for building customer-centric solutions and simulating performance scenarios in cloud environments.

Overall, synthetic data is transforming the landscape for data-driven companies by offering innovative solutions that improve efficiency, compliance, and revenue generation while minimizing risks associated with data privacy.

The insurance industry is experiencing a transformation, driven by the rise of agile insurtech startups and the need to leverage vast amounts of data to improve customer experiences, develop new products, and identify risks. However, adherence to data protection regulations is limiting the agility of data usage, resulting in reduced productivity and missed opportunities for enhancing services.

Synthetic data emerges as a solution, enabling insurance companies to access a synthetic version of sensitive data efficiently. This reduces the time required for data access from years to months or even days, which in turn decreases costs and enhances team efficiency. It also improves fraud detection models and aids in more accurate risk predictions by analyzing complex data patterns.

Privacy-preserving synthetic data minimizes privacy risks, crucial for compliance with increasing data regulations. By ensuring no personally identifiable information is exposed, it mitigates risks associated with data breaches.

In conclusion, synthetic data offers insurance agencies a valuable resource, streamlining data acquisition, maintaining its utility, and alleviating privacy concerns. Its adoption is essential for enhancing data agility, fostering innovation, and ultimately maintaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving insurance landscape.
