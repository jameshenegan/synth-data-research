# How does synthetic data get generated?

Methods of Generation

Statistical Modeling: Building a model (e.g., a regression) on real data, then sampling new (synthetic) records from that model.
Simulation / Randomization: Creating entirely artificial patterns or networks to study and refine algorithms.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Producing high-fidelity synthetic samples that can sometimes rival real data quality in domains like computer vision.

# 30 years of synthetic data

April, 2023
Drechsler

Over the past 30 years, **synthetic data** has evolved into a critical method for protecting confidentiality while enabling broader access to sensitive microdata. Below is an overview of the field’s development and key concepts:

1. **Historical Context and Motivation**

   - Initially proposed by Rubin (1993) and Little (1993) as an adaptation of multiple imputation, synthetic data replaces original values (fully or partially) with model-based draws.
   - Early milestones include U.S. Federal Reserve applications in 1997, the U.S. Census Bureau’s large-scale SIPP Synthetic Beta in 2007, and numerous national statistical offices adopting the approach.

2. **Statistical vs. Computer Science Approaches**

   - **Statistical**: Emphasizes valid inference, adapting multiple imputation combining rules (e.g., Reiter, 2003). Methods include sequential regression, Bayesian mixtures, and custom modeling for different data types.
   - **Computer Science**: Historically focused on anonymity measures (k-anonymity, l-diversity). With the rise of **differential privacy (DP)**, new frameworks emerged (e.g., PrivBayes, DP-GAN). Machine learning methods—like GANs and autoencoders—help generate synthetic datasets that maintain useful statistical properties while limiting disclosure risks.

3. **Combining Rules for Valid Inference**

   - **Fully Synthetic**: All records replaced. Special variance estimators (e.g., from Raghunathan et al., 2003) account for the extra sampling step.
   - **Partially Synthetic**: Only certain sensitive values replaced. Its variance formulas (Reiter, 2003) avoid negative estimates but differ from the fully synthetic approach.
   - **Alternative Estimators** (Raab et al., 2016) allow valid inference from a single synthetic dataset, which can reduce disclosure risk.

4. **Taxonomy of Methods**

   - **Sequential vs. Joint Modeling**: Synthesizing one variable at a time vs. modeling entire distributions at once.
   - **Parametric vs. Machine Learning**: Traditional statistical models vs. automated, high-dimensional methods (random forests, GANs, etc.).
   - **Formal Privacy Guarantees vs. No Formal Guarantees**: Whether the method provides mathematically rigorous privacy (e.g., DP).
   - **Extensions of MI Approaches**: Multi-stage synthesis, subsampling before synthesis, and handling missing data jointly with disclosure protection.

5. **Differentially Private Data Synthesis**

   - DP imposes a strict bound on how much a single record can affect published outputs, offering strong formal guarantees.
   - Methods include adding noise to margins (e.g., MWEM), Bayesian networks (PrivBayes), copulas (DPCopula), and DP-enhanced GANs.

6. **Utility Evaluation**

   - **Global Metrics**: Distances (Kullback-Leibler, Hellinger) or propensity score measures (pMSE) that compare real vs. synthetic data in aggregate.
   - **Outcome-Specific Metrics**: Compare specific analyses (e.g., regression coefficients, ML accuracy) on real vs. synthetic datasets.
   - **Fit-for-Purpose**: Graphical checks, plausibility checks, and goodness-of-fit statistics (like chi-square, Kolmogorov-Smirnov) to diagnose modeling quality and identify problematic variables.

7. **Risk Assessment**
   - **Fully Synthetic**: No direct one-to-one link with original records, but potential leakage of sensitive information remains (e.g., exact replication of records, membership attacks).
   - **Partially Synthetic**: One-to-one correspondence persists for replaced records, so re-identification metrics (e.g., expected match risk, true/false match rates) can be calculated.

In summary, the field of synthetic data has grown from early theoretical ideas to a broad spectrum of practical tools and frameworks. Researchers and practitioners balance **utility** (ensuring analyses on synthetic data mirror those on real data) with **confidentiality** (minimizing risks of identifying or inferring sensitive information). Ongoing innovations in machine learning, differential privacy, and model-based synthesis continue to shape the future of synthetic data generation.

## Abstract

In an increasingly data-driven world, there is growing tension between the benefits of broad data availability for research, policy, and industry applications on the one hand, and the need to protect confidentiality and privacy on the other. Traditional techniques (such as swapping and suppression) have become insufficient in light of advancing computational power and the proliferation of publicly available data.

A key emerging solution is the use of **synthetic data**—artificially generated datasets that preserve many statistical properties of the original data without directly revealing sensitive information. Originating from ideas by Rubin and Little in the early 1990s, synthetic data methods were initially motivated by the concept of multiple imputation (filling in missing values), but have expanded significantly over the last three decades. Separate strands of development arose within statistics (focusing on valid inference and uncertainty assessment) and computer science (focusing on creating training data for machine learning).

These approaches share the goal that analyses performed on synthetic data should produce results similar to those that would have been obtained with real data, while reducing the risk of disclosure. Applications now span government agencies, health research (including synthetic patient and electronic health record data), and various industrial contexts (ranging from autonomous driving to environmental monitoring). As synthetic data methods gain momentum, researchers continue to refine approaches for balancing utility and privacy, measuring disclosure risk, and potentially enhancing usability through verification servers.

## A Brief History

### The Statistical Approach

**Origins and Early Development**

- The concept of releasing _synthetic data_ for disclosure protection dates back to **Rubin (1993)**, who proposed adapting his multiple imputation framework to replace original records entirely with data imputed from a model.
- **Little (1993)** introduced the idea of _partially synthetic_ datasets, whereby only high-risk or sensitive values are replaced, striking a balance between privacy and analytical usefulness.
- **Fienberg (1994)** offered a related approach—releasing bootstrap samples from smoothed estimates of the empirical distribution.

**Methodological Foundations**

- Around a decade later, **Raghunathan et al. (2003)** and **Reiter (2003)** formalized how to draw valid inferences from fully and partially synthetic data, adapting the combining rules from multiple imputation for nonresponse.
- Subsequent work (e.g., **Reiter & Kinney, 2012**; **Raab et al., 2016**) refined these methods, clarifying differences in how model parameters are drawn for partial versus full synthesis and providing guidance for scenarios with a single synthetic dataset.

**Key Applications**

- **Earliest Use (1997):** The U.S. Federal Reserve Board replaced high-disclosure-risk monetary values in the Survey of Consumer Finances (Kennickell, 1997).
- **Complex Linked Data:** Abowd & Woodcock demonstrated the feasibility with French longitudinal data; later, the U.S. Census Bureau released the _SIPP Synthetic Beta_ (2007), a large-scale synthetic product linking survey data with administrative records.
- **OnTheMap** used synthetic data with formal privacy guarantees (a variant of differential privacy).
- **Further Major Products:**
  - _Synthetic Longitudinal Business Database_ (U.S. Census Bureau)
  - Synthetic data for the _American Community Survey (ACS)_
  - Maryland Longitudinal Data System Center’s _Synthetic Data Project_
- **International Adoption:**
  - Statistics New Zealand’s _Synthetic Unit Record Files_ (SURFs)
  - German Institute for Employment Research’s partial synthesis of its Establishment Panel
  - Scottish Longitudinal Study providing synthetic extracts for external researchers
  - Statistics Netherlands’ synthetic version of EU-SILC for training and code development
  - Statistics Canada’s hackathon datasets (2020)

**Recent Directions**

- Ongoing projects include synthetic tax data (Urban Institute & IRS), and initiatives by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to broaden microdata access.
- Methodological advances address challenges like synthesizing business data, handling nested structures, preserving additive constraints, protecting geospatial data, and accommodating complex survey designs.

Overall, the field has progressed from early theoretical proposals to widespread practical applications in government, research, and industry, all aiming to provide broader data access while preserving confidentiality.

### The Computer Science Approach

Traditionally, computer science literature on data privacy focused on standards like _k_-anonymity, _l_-diversity, and _t_-closeness, which primarily address how the _released data themselves_ must look to prevent re-identification. Synthetic data—which do not neatly fit these standards—drew relatively little attention until the advent of **differential privacy (DP)** (Dwork et al., 2006). By shifting the focus from the data to the _mechanism_ generating the data, DP opened the door to synthetic data solutions that satisfy formal privacy guarantees.

Early work on **differentially private synthetic data** includes Barak et al. (2007) (using Fourier transformations for contingency tables) and other studies (e.g., Eno & Thompson, 2008; Blum et al., 2011). These were soon followed by methods integrating statistical modeling with DP (Abowd & Vilhuber, 2008; Machanavajjhala et al., 2008; Charest, 2011). Meanwhile, **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, introduced by Goodfellow et al. (2014), propelled synthetic data research—initially for images, then adapted to **microdata** (e.g., medGAN, CTGAN). Outside GAN-based approaches, other techniques rely on Bayesian networks (PrivBayes), copulas (DPCopula), or autoencoders.

Practical deployments of differentially private synthetic data include **OnTheMap** (Machanavajjhala et al., 2008), which uses a relaxed form of DP, and the **2020 Decennial Census** in the U.S., whose “TopDown” algorithm can be viewed as producing synthetic microdata from noisy counts. Broader interest in these approaches is reflected in events like the **NIST Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge** (2018–2019), where participants tested diverse strategies (often relying on Bayesian networks or marginal-preserving methods). Beyond microdata, computer science researchers apply GANs to generate realistic synthetic medical images and records—further illustrating the rapidly expanding use of synthetic data under formal privacy frameworks.

## Obtaining valid inferences for the MI inspired approaches

Rubin’s original idea to create synthetic data was inspired by multiple imputation (MI) for nonresponse. Although similar, two major differences from MI require adjusted combining rules for analyzing synthetic datasets:

1. **Fully Synthetic Data**

   - All records are replaced (or drawn from a model for a new sample).
   - The established combining rules (Raghunathan et al., 2003) must account for this extra sampling step.
   - The usual variance formula can become negative, prompting a modified approach (Reiter, 2002) that is always nonnegative but can slightly overestimate variance.

2. **Partially Synthetic Data**

   - Only certain records (often high-risk or sensitive) are replaced.
   - Combining rules (Reiter, 2003) differ because the model uses the full dataset to create synthetic values.
   - Unlike the fully synthetic case, the variance estimator here cannot be negative.

3. **Alternative Variance Estimator for Fully Synthetic Data**
   - In practice, researchers often skip Rubin’s two-step sampling procedure and use only the observed dataset to build the synthesis model.
   - This approach can be treated like an “extreme” form of partially synthetic data, so partial-synthesis combining rules still work.
   - Raab et al. (2016) propose a variance formula based solely on the “within-imputation” variance.
     - It never becomes negative.
     - It has less variability compared to the traditional fully synthetic formula.
     - It permits valid inferences from a single synthetic dataset (important for reducing disclosure risk).

Overall, these combining rules ensure valid inferences from synthetic data, balancing ease of implementation and protection against disclosure.

## A taxonomy of synthetic data approaches

Synthetic data methods are diverse, making it challenging to adopt a single taxonomy. Beyond distinguishing between **statistical (multiple-imputation-inspired)** and **computer-science-oriented** approaches, three additional classification schemes are useful:

1. **Sequential vs. Joint Modeling**

   - **Sequential Modeling**: Synthesizes each variable in turn, conditioning on previously synthesized or original variables. This allows flexibility in choosing a different model for each variable (e.g., parametric or machine learning).
   - **Joint Modeling**: Directly models the entire joint distribution of the data at once. Traditional versions assumed simple distributions (e.g., multivariate normal), but newer methods include more flexible mixture models, Bayesian network approaches, and GAN-based techniques.

2. **Parametric vs. Machine Learning-Based**

   - **Parametric**: Relies on specified statistical models, which may struggle with large numbers of variables or complex interactions.
   - **Machine Learning**: Techniques like random forests, CART, Support Vector Machines, or neural networks “let the data speak” by automatically capturing interactions. They also avoid collinearity and perfect prediction issues common in large datasets.

3. **Formal Privacy Guarantees vs. No Formal Guarantees**
   - Some methods, especially in computer science (e.g., differential privacy frameworks), explicitly include privacy parameters and formal proofs of disclosure risk.
   - Other methods rely on informal risk assessments and do not provide strict privacy guarantees.

A further **fourth category** includes **extensions of the multiple-imputation (MI) approach**, which might require specialized inferential procedures beyond the standard formulas. For example:

- Jointly handling missing data and disclosure risk with two-stage synthesis.
- Using subsampling before synthesis, potentially improving utility by fitting models on the full population while only releasing a synthetic sample.

Finally, the **computer-science approaches** often leverage:

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, which use two neural networks (generator and discriminator) in an adversarial setup. Variations include Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) and Causal-TGAN.
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**, featuring encoder and decoder networks (plus a discriminator) for learning latent representations and reconstructing data.

All of these methods aim to produce synthetic datasets that protect privacy while maintaining as much analytical utility as possible.

## Differential Private Data Synthesis

**1. Differential Privacy (DP) Basics**

- DP (Dwork et al., 2006) imposes a strict bound on how much one individual record can affect an output’s probability distribution.
- In simple terms, it ensures that an observer cannot determine whether any single individual’s data was used in generating the published result.
- Large organizations (e.g., Apple, Google, Microsoft, US Census Bureau) have adopted DP for some of their data products.

**2. Advantages of Differentially Private Synthetic Data**

- DP is _immune to post-processing_: any subsequent operation on a DP output remains DP.
- Thus, researchers can analyze or share _differentially private synthetic data_ freely without added disclosure risk.

**3. Approaches to Differentially Private Synthetic Data**

- **Marginal Distributions**: Adding noise to one-, two-, or three-way margins (e.g., McKenna et al. 2019, Liu et al. 2021).
- **Bayesian Networks**: For instance, PrivBayes (Zhang et al. 2017) and PrivMRF (Cai et al. 2021) model variable correlations.
- **Game-Based Optimization**: Techniques like MWEM (Hardt et al. 2012) optimize specific queries under DP guarantees.
- **Copula Functions**: DPCopula (Li et al. 2014) uses copulas to capture dependencies.

**4. DP in GANs**

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** increasingly incorporate DP by adding noise and gradient clipping during training.
- Only the discriminator network typically needs DP modifications; the generator never directly sees raw data.
- Prominent examples include methods by Beaulieu-Jones et al. (2019), Xie et al. (2018), and Yoon et al. (2019), often extending WGANs or using frameworks like PATE (Papernot et al. 2018).
- Neunhoeffer et al. (2021) propose combining multiple DP-trained generators to improve the utility of the final synthetic dataset.

Overall, differentially private synthetic data aim to preserve analytical utility while providing _formal_ and _rigorous_ privacy guarantees.

## Utility Evaluation

Researchers use **utility metrics** to assess how well synthetic data preserve analytical validity compared to the original data. These measures fall into three broad categories:

1. **Global Utility Metrics**

   - Compare original and synthetic datasets on an aggregated level, often without assuming a particular analysis.
   - Common approaches include **distance measures** (e.g., Kullback-Leibler, Hellinger) and **propensity-score-based** methods.
   - A popular example is **pMSE** (propensity mean squared error), which measures how effectively a combined model can distinguish between real and synthetic records. Smaller values generally imply higher similarity.
   - However, these metrics can be sensitive to model specification (e.g., how the propensity model is built) and may not always reflect performance for specific analyses.

2. **Outcome-Specific Utility Measures**

   - Directly evaluate how well the synthetic data replicate particular statistical or machine learning results.
   - Examples include plotting estimates (e.g., regression coefficients) from original vs. synthetic data, checking **confidence interval overlaps**, or comparing **ML performance** (accuracy, F1 scores) on a shared test set.
   - These methods reveal how well synthetic data support specific analyses of interest.

3. **Fit-for-Purpose Measures**
   - Provide a **first diagnostic** for potential issues in the synthetic dataset.
   - **Graphical checks** (e.g., side-by-side distributions, contour plots) highlight differences in marginal or conditional distributions.
   - **Plausibility checks** look for clearly impossible values or relationships (e.g., negative ages, overly large changes in turnover).
   - **Goodness-of-fit metrics** (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov, chi-square statistics) quantify how closely the synthetic data match the original on selected features.
   - These should not be used for formal hypothesis tests (original and synthetic are not independent), but rather as guides to compare different synthesis strategies or identify problematic variables.

In practice, many of these measures are **highly correlated**, so using just one or two well-chosen metrics (plus graphical checks) often suffices to gauge the synthetic data’s overall quality.

## Risk Assessment

Assessing disclosure risk differs substantially between **fully** and **partially** synthetic datasets:

1. **Fully Synthetic Data**

   - No one-to-one link exists between original and synthetic records (the synthetic dataset can even be a different size).
   - **Direct re-identification metrics** (like matching records) are less meaningful. However, fully synthetic data can still leak sensitive information, especially if the synthesizer “overfits” and replicates real records.
   - Proposed risk measures include:
     - **Counting unique matches** of records in synthetic vs. original data (mostly addresses perceived risk).
     - **Distances** between synthetic and original records (although what constitutes “high risk” is not always clear).
     - **Equivalence-class-based measures** (e.g., WEAP, TCAP) that consider “key” and “target” variables.
     - **Membership-attack analyses**, which investigate whether someone can learn if a specific individual is in the original data (of special concern for sensitive populations).
     - **Posterior-based approaches** (e.g., Reiter et al. 2014), which assess how much an attacker’s knowledge of specific attributes can be refined after seeing the synthetic data.
   - In practice, **quantifying** these risks in realistic, high-dimensional scenarios remains challenging, and more research is needed.

2. **Partially Synthetic Data**
   - Some original attributes remain; each synthetic record corresponds to exactly one real record.
   - **Re-identification risk** can be calculated by estimating the probability that an attacker correctly matches a synthetic record to a real target.
   - Key steps (Reiter & Mitra 2009; Drechsler & Reiter 2010):
     1. Assume the intruder has external knowledge about one target’s “key” variables.
     2. For any synthesized attributes, simulate plausible values.
     3. Use a matching algorithm (e.g., nearest neighbor) to compute the probability that a synthetic record matches the attacker’s target.
     4. Summarize probabilities into metrics such as **expected match risk**, **true match rate**, and **false match rate**.
   - Extensions exist for cases where an intruder is unsure whether the target is even in the dataset (handling sampling uncertainty).

Overall, **full and partial synthesis** each require **different risk frameworks**. While partial synthesis can be evaluated using re-identification-based methods, fully synthetic data demand alternative approaches that focus on potential “leakage” of underlying distributions and membership information.

# Synthetic Data

2021

## Abstract

Based on the comprehensive literature review provided, here are some key insights regarding synthetic data generation and GANs:

1. Synthetic data generation has become increasingly important to address issues of insufficient, poor quality, or unlabeled data across many fields including physics, finance, healthcare, sports, and agriculture.

2. GANs have emerged as one of the most powerful and popular techniques for generating high-quality synthetic data, especially for image generation tasks. Yann LeCun described GANs as "the most interesting idea in the last 10 years in machine learning".

3. There has been rapid evolution of GAN architectures since their introduction in 2014, with key innovations including conditional GANs, DCGANs, WGANs, and StyleGANs among many others. These have dramatically improved the quality and control of synthetic data generation.

4. While GANs excel at image generation, generating high-quality synthetic tabular data remains challenging. Specialized GAN architectures like TGAN, CTGAN and TabFairGAN have been developed to address the unique properties of tabular data.

5. Evaluating the quality of synthetic data is complex and context-dependent. Common approaches include assessing machine learning model performance, statistical similarity to real data, and human evaluation of realism.

6. Beyond GANs, other important synthetic data generation techniques include SMOTE and its variants, autoencoders, and Gaussian mixture models. Each has strengths and weaknesses for different data types and use cases.

7. Synthetic data has shown promise for data augmentation, privacy preservation, and overcoming data scarcity in many domains. However, care must be taken to avoid introducing biases or artifacts.

8. The field of synthetic data generation is rapidly evolving, with new techniques and applications emerging frequently. Ongoing research aims to improve quality, controllability, and applicability across diverse domains.

## Summary

**Summary**

This article surveys the concept, methods, and challenges of generating **synthetic data**—artificially constructed datasets that preserve key statistical properties of the original, confidential data while reducing the risk of disclosing sensitive respondent information.

1. **Motivation and Background**

   - **Data Access vs. Confidentiality**: Publicly funded data are crucial for societal benefits such as policy research. However, increased risks of identifying individuals (e.g., via external databases) necessitate effective statistical disclosure control.
   - **Synthetic Data as a Solution**: Traditional methods alter original data through swapping, coarsening, or suppression, which can distort analyses. Synthetic data generation offers a structured way to protect privacy while retaining most analytical value.

2. **Types of Synthetic Data Approaches**

   - **Full Synthesis**: All records and variables are replaced with simulated values drawn from a fitted statistical model. The approach builds on Bayesian modeling and multiple imputation ideas, generating multiple synthetic datasets. Analysts combine estimates across these to obtain valid inferences.
   - **Partial (or Selective) Synthesis**: Only sensitive or identifying variables (or subsets of records) are simulated, leaving the remaining data unchanged. This reduces how much of the dataset must be altered, but requires careful inference techniques adapted to partial changes in the data.

3. **Ensuring Valid Statistical Inferences**

   - **Frequentist and Bayesian Perspectives**: Synthetic data must yield estimates (e.g., means, regression coefficients) and interval coverage close to those obtained from the actual data. In Bayesian terms, the posterior distribution based on the synthetic data should approximate the posterior from the real data.
   - **Combining Rules**: For multiple synthetic datasets, specialized formulas account for both within- and between-dataset variability. These help keep confidence intervals calibrated and unbiased.

4. **Differential Privacy**

   - With the growing availability of external information, **differential privacy** provides a formal, mathematically guaranteed framework. By constraining how much any single record influences the released data, it ensures that an attacker cannot reliably learn confidential details—regardless of external data sources.
   - **Challenges**: Generating differentially private synthetic data that remain highly useful for diverse analyses is complex. Current methods often focus on tabular data and must balance privacy budgets with statistical utility.

5. **Software Tools**

   - Packages like **synthpop** (in R) and **IVEware** implement sequential regression approaches to generate synthetic data, handling diverse variable types and (optionally) complex survey designs or missingness.

6. **Limitations and Future Directions**
   - **Model Fit and Flexibility**: Synthetic data rely on an underlying model; if analysts later use a more complex model than the one used for synthesis, biases can arise (“uncongeniality”). More robust or nonparametric synthesis methods are needed to accommodate a wide range of analyses.
   - **Longitudinal Data**: Iteratively releasing synthetic data in multiwave or panel studies raises additional challenges (e.g., ensuring consistency across waves).
   - **Building User Trust**: Researchers may distrust synthetic data if they fear it will not yield valid results. Clear documentation, validation studies, and transparency about limitations can help foster confidence.

Overall, **synthetic data** techniques—whether full, partial, or integrated with differential privacy—offer a powerful avenue to balance **data utility** and **privacy protection**. Yet continued research is needed to address model flexibility, longitudinal contexts, and user skepticism, ensuring that these methods can robustly support the broad range of analyses necessary for informed policy and scientific inquiry.

## Abstract

**Summary**

This explainer highlights the growing importance of **synthetic data**—artificially generated data designed to resemble real datasets—for a variety of applications, including **privacy**, **fairness**, and **data augmentation**. It examines both the **potential** of synthetic data and the **challenges** that arise in its practical deployment.

1. **Significant Potential**

   - **Privacy**: Well-crafted synthetic data can support data sharing without exposing sensitive information.
   - **Fairness**: Generating de-biased or balanced data can help reduce systematic discrimination.
   - **Data Augmentation**: Creating additional samples can improve model robustness and training efficiency.
   - **Project Acceleration**: Synthetic data facilitates faster prototyping and testing in data science and software development pipelines.

2. **Not Automatically Private**

   - Simply generating data does not ensure anonymity; synthetic datasets may still leak sensitive information.
   - Formal methods (e.g., **differential privacy**) are often needed to provide rigorous privacy guarantees.

3. **No Perfect Substitute for Real Data**

   - Privacy-preserving synthetic data inevitably distorts certain features, which may reduce its usefulness for some tasks.
   - For high-stakes applications, final models typically need validation or fine-tuning on real data.

4. **Difficulties with Outliers and Rare Events**

   - Unusual or extreme data points (e.g., billionaires in a wealth dataset) are harder to represent privately.
   - Synthetic data may either omit them (leading to poor fidelity) or inadvertently reveal sensitive details.

5. **Challenges in Privacy Evaluation**

   - **Rigorous privacy** focuses on how the data was generated, not on the dataset alone.
   - Empirical checks can reveal flaws but can also give false confidence if not carefully conducted.

6. **Complexity of Black-Box Generative Models**

   - Large, overparameterized models like deep neural networks can produce high-fidelity synthetic data.
   - Their internal workings can be opaque, making it difficult to assess privacy and accuracy consistently.

7. **Beyond Privacy**
   - Synthetic data can advance **fairness, bias reduction**, and **robustness** in machine learning.
   - Further research is needed to understand both the opportunities and potential pitfalls fully.

Overall, **synthetic data** is a powerful tool but must be used **strategically**—with careful design, clear objectives, and robust validations—to ensure the right balance between utility and privacy.

## Introduction

**Summary**

Organizations today have access to massive and diverse datasets with the potential to significantly improve decision-making and fuel research. However, privacy regulations (such as GDPR and CCPA), along with inherent vulnerabilities in high-dimensional data, make sharing or using real data difficult. Traditional anonymization often fails to protect individual privacy, creating a bottleneck in deploying data-driven techniques.

**Synthetic data** offers a potential solution. By generating artificial datasets that approximate the statistical properties of real data, one can:

- **Control privacy**: Limit the risk of re-identification by carefully regulating the similarity between synthetic and real data.
- **Mitigate bias**: Adjust historical imbalances and explore plausible hypothetical scenarios.
- **Facilitate innovation**: Provide safe, representative test environments for researchers, startups, and developers, supporting rapid prototyping and validation of machine learning systems.

Despite its promise, synthetic data also presents challenges. Ensuring utility (the data’s usefulness for model training), fidelity (faithful representation of original data characteristics), and privacy (protection against re-identification) requires well-designed techniques and frameworks. Moreover, generating synthetic data for fairness and data augmentation necessitates specialized methods.

In this report, the authors introduce:

1. **Definition and history** of synthetic data: Explaining key concepts and early motivations.
2. **Applications** in machine learning: Highlighting how synthetic data can drive model development and testing.
3. **Privacy frameworks** (e.g., differential privacy): Discussing limitations and how they intersect with synthetic data generation.
4. **Evaluation metrics**: Outlining how to assess utility, fidelity, and privacy of synthetic data.
5. **Private synthetic data generation methods**: Surveying existing techniques and exploring hybrid real-synthetic approaches.
6. **Fairness and data augmentation**: Examining how synthetic data can reduce bias and expand training sets.
7. **Technical survey of generative models**: Reviewing the modern tools that enable effective synthetic data creation.
8. **Industry perspectives**: Summarizing insights from startups and practitioners on deploying synthetic data responsibly.

Ultimately, while synthetic data can preserve privacy, improve research workflows, and expand innovation opportunities, careful strategies are required to ensure that the data is both safe and valuable for its intended uses.

## What is Synthetic Data?

**Summary**

The text provides an overview of **synthetic data**—data generated by a mathematical model rather than real-world processes—and addresses key questions around its definition, potential applications, and limitations.

1. **Definition and History**

   - **Synthetic data** is defined as data generated by a purpose-built model or algorithm to solve data science tasks.
   - It contrasts with **real data**, which stems from actual processes (e.g., financial transactions, medical tests).
   - Synthetic data has a long history, dating back to Monte Carlo methods in the 1940s. Researchers often use it for **“ground truth”** simulations, facilitating model development and evaluation.

2. **Motivations**

   - **Privacy Regulations**: Stricter rules (e.g., GDPR) encourage synthetic data as a way to share information without disclosing identifiable real data.
   - **Bias Removal**: Synthetic data can be engineered to reduce or remove historical biases related to attributes like gender or race.
   - **Data Augmentation**: Synthetic data can expand limited real datasets to improve the robustness of machine learning models.
   - **Privacy Protection**: There is hope that synthetic data, if generated properly, can replace sensitive real data and mitigate disclosure risks.

3. **Challenges**

   - **No Automatic Privacy**: Simply generating data with standard methods (like GANs) does not guarantee privacy—models can memorize and inadvertently reveal real examples.
   - **No Automatic Bias Mitigation**: Off-the-shelf synthetic data generation can perpetuate existing biases if not explicitly addressed.
   - **Quality and Realism Trade-Off**: There is often tension between data realism (for utility) and privacy protection.

4. **Key Questions**

   1. _Can synthetic data be used in place of real data to do the same tasks (training models, hypothesis testing, data analysis)?_
      - Yes in principle, but specialized methods (e.g., Bayesian updates for model parameters, bias-correction strategies) often improve accuracy when dealing with synthetic data.
   2. _Can synthetic data be treated exactly like real data (e.g., linking records from different datasets)?_
      - Linking different synthetic datasets independently generated from real data can break 1-to-1 correspondence across records. Specialized approaches—or regenerating a single, joint synthetic dataset—may be needed.

5. **Integrations with Other Privacy Technologies**
   - **Secure Research Environments**: Synthetic data can be used in a tiered approach—start with strongly private synthetic versions, refine methods, and only grant access to more sensitive real data as needed.
   - **Federated Learning**: Synthetic data can help develop and test machine learning models locally, without pooling real data in a central location.

Overall, while synthetic data has significant promise for privacy, bias reduction, and data augmentation, **proper techniques and careful design** are essential to ensure that it meets the intended goals of utility and privacy.

## Why Use Synthetic Data?

The text highlights three main ways synthetic data is used within machine learning:

1. **Private Data Release**

   - **Development of ML tools**: Organizations share synthetic data with potential partners or researchers so they can develop or compare machine learning models without exposing sensitive real data. The synthetic data must preserve statistical properties needed to evaluate models reliably.
   - **Software testing**: Synthetic data supports system testing and User Acceptance Testing without privacy concerns. Here, it needs to reflect realistic (but not necessarily statistically accurate) structures and formats.
   - **Deploying private ML tools**: Although one could train models entirely on private synthetic data, it often loses key statistical nuances. Typically, better results come from models trained directly on real data with privacy controls integrated into the training process rather than relying solely on synthetic data.

2. **De-biasing**

   - **Reducing or removing bias**: Synthetic data can be generated to remove historical biases in attributes such as gender or race, providing a fairer dataset for training. This can create a consistent approach to fairness across multiple models within an organization.
   - **What-if scenarios**: Synthetic data, generated from carefully defined causal models, can explore alternate realities or interventions (e.g., changing distributions or causal links) to see how the system might behave under different conditions. These techniques introduce model risk and require careful validation.

3. **Data Augmentation**
   - **Data labeling**: Industries rely on vast, accurately labeled data for deep learning models, particularly in computer vision. Synthetic data can cost-effectively supply labeled examples to bolster real datasets and improve model robustness, though privacy is often not the main concern in this specific use case.

In each of these scenarios, synthetic data must strike a balance between utility (realistic, relevant for the intended task) and any privacy or fairness objectives. The success of synthetic data depends heavily on how it is generated, validated, and integrated into broader workflows.

## Privacy in Machine Learning - An Overview

**Summary**

This section provides an overview of privacy in machine learning, emphasizing the risks and defenses involved when sharing or analyzing data:

1. **Privacy Motivation**

   - Individuals consent to data collection under the assumption it will not be used to harm them (e.g., by revealing sensitive health information).
   - Sharing data can foster collaboration (as in open benchmark datasets like MNIST or CIFAR) but also poses risks to personal privacy.

2. **Threat Model Approach**

   - **Membership Inference**: An attacker determines whether a specific individual was part of a dataset (e.g., identifying someone’s involvement in a sensitive clinical study).
   - **Attribute Inference**: An attacker predicts missing attributes (e.g., revealing someone’s smoking status). Although inference is a core goal of machine learning, it can become a privacy violation if the attacker’s predictions are substantially improved by an individual’s inclusion in the dataset.
   - **Reconstruction Attacks**: An attacker attempts to recover entire records (for instance, reconstructing exact data of individuals from aggregate statistics).

3. **Differential Privacy (DP)**

   - **Definition**: DP ensures that the algorithm’s output changes minimally when any one individual’s data is added or removed, limiting the potential privacy harm.
   - **Interpretation**: If a person opts out of the dataset, DP guarantees the algorithm’s output will not change “too much,” thus severely limiting information leakage about that person.
   - **Properties**:
     - _Composability_: Multiple DP operations combine to still maintain DP guarantees.
     - _Resistance to Post-Processing_: Any transformations on DP outputs remain DP.
     - _Bayesian Interpretation_: DP bounds how much posterior beliefs (e.g., about an individual’s presence in a dataset) can change relative to prior knowledge.

4. **Limitations of DP**
   - **Choosing Parameters (ε, δ)**: Selecting the privacy parameters that balance protection and utility is notoriously difficult and context-dependent.
   - **Relaxations**: Variants (e.g., approximate DP, Rényi DP) address practical concerns but can be harder to interpret. Overly conservative assumptions can lower utility by adding too much noise.

Overall, differential privacy is a widely accepted framework for protecting individuals in machine learning systems, but implementing it effectively requires careful design and a context-sensitive choice of privacy parameters.

## Utility, Fidelity and Privacy of Synthetic Data

**Summary**

The text discusses the core attributes and design principles for meaningful synthetic data, emphasizing that it should be **similar** to the real data but also **different** enough to avoid replicating the same issues (privacy, bias, or small sample size). The authors identify **three main attributes**—utility, fidelity, and privacy—along with additional practical considerations:

1. **Utility**

   - Refers to how well synthetic data performs on specific tasks compared to real data.
   - Often assessed using the “Train on Synthetic, Test on Real” (TSTR) approach, where models are trained on synthetic data and then evaluated on real data.
   - Other utility considerations include model fairness and general performance metrics (accuracy, precision, etc.).

2. **Fidelity**

   - Measures how closely the synthetic data statistically matches the real dataset.
   - Involves comparing distributions or structural properties (e.g., time-series dependencies, valid postcodes).
   - Full statistical match can be undesirable if the original data is biased or if privacy needs require reducing fidelity.

3. **Privacy**

   - Concerns how much real-data information might be revealed through the synthetic data.
   - Formalized by frameworks such as differential privacy, which provides worst-case guarantees about limiting information leakage.
   - Generally, higher fidelity can decrease privacy, so there’s a **trade-off** between privacy and fidelity.

4. **Synthetic Data Desiderata**

   - **Syntactical Accuracy**: Generated data should be plausible, respecting domain-specific constraints (e.g., valid postcodes, correct time-series ordering).
   - **Privacy**: Quantifiable and robust, typically captured through definitions like differential privacy or similar approaches.
   - **Statistical Accuracy**: Relevant statistical properties (distributions, correlations) should match real data to the extent needed by the use case.
   - **Efficiency**: The method should scale with the dimension of the dataset; generating synthetic data in high-dimensional spaces is computationally challenging.

5. **Challenges and Impossibility Results**
   - There is no universal, computationally efficient method that provides **both** strong privacy guarantees **and** perfect fidelity for all correlations.
   - Instead, generation methods must prioritize which relationships in the data are most crucial for the intended use case.
   - Some relaxations (e.g., preserving “most” correlations rather than all) are possible but require careful assessment to understand what information might be lost.

Overall, **synthetic data must be tailored to specific use cases** to balance utility, fidelity, and privacy. A one-size-fits-all solution does not exist; instead, data scientists must decide which data characteristics are essential and which can be relaxed to enhance privacy or reduce bias.

## Auditing Synthetic Data

**Summary**

This section explores how to empirically evaluate synthetic data along two main dimensions—**privacy** and **utility/fidelity**:

---

### 1. Evaluating the Privacy of Synthetic Data

1. **Differential Privacy Verification**

   - Differential privacy (DP) is a property of the _algorithm_ rather than the final dataset.
   - Researchers have proposed methods to check compliance with DP by querying or attacking the generation algorithm, but true “proof” requires a formal DP analysis rather than just empirical tests.

2. **Leakage Estimation**

   - Techniques from **quantitative information flow** can estimate how much private information a synthetic data generator leaks under specific threat models (e.g., membership inference).
   - These methods often treat the generator as a “black box,” requiring multiple samples but can help in practice to tune or compare privacy parameters.

3. **Empirical Tests on Final Datasets**

   - Some practitioners use a **hold-out test set** (i.e., Nearest-Neighbour Distance Ratio, NNDR) to compare synthetic data points to real data points.
   - However, such metrics can miss “holes” where the generator deliberately avoids real data points, and thus do not fully capture privacy risks.

4. **Privacy Attacks**
   - **Membership and Attribute Inference Attacks**: These can be adapted to test whether synthetic data leaks information about who was in the original dataset or which attributes they had.
   - **Black-Box Adversarial Approaches**: Recent work (e.g., shadow modeling) highlights vulnerabilities in many synthetic data generators, suggesting that strong privacy often degrades accuracy.

---

### 2. Evaluating Utility and Fidelity

**Utility** and **fidelity** are related but distinct concepts:

- **Utility** focuses on **task performance**: For instance, how well a model trained on synthetic data performs on (or ranks models for) a real-world task.
- **Fidelity** measures how **statistically similar** the synthetic data is to the real data, often without reference to a particular downstream task.

#### 2.1 Utility-Driven Evaluation

1. **Train on Synthetic, Test on Real**

   - Analysts train a machine learning model on synthetic data and then measure performance on real data.
   - If performance is good (e.g., classification accuracy, AUROC), the synthetic data is considered useful for that task.

2. **Model Selection**
   - Synthetic data can be used to compare models or hyperparameters.
   - The ranking of models (best to worst) on synthetic data should ideally match the ranking on real data.

#### 2.2 Fidelity-Driven Evaluation

1. **Low-Dimensional Checks**

   - Compare 1- or 2-dimensional marginals (histograms, correlations) between real and synthetic data.
   - Measures such as total variation distance, correlation coefficients, or Cramer’s V can indicate how closely the distributions match on these limited dimensions.

2. **Higher-Dimensional Metrics**
   - **Propensity scores**: Train a classifier to differentiate real vs. synthetic samples; lower classification accuracy implies better fidelity.
   - **GAN-Based Metrics**: Precision and recall for generative models evaluate how well synthetic data covers the real data “support” (recall) and avoids generating unrealistic samples (precision).

---

**Key Takeaways**

- **Privacy Evaluation**:

  - True differential privacy must be proven at the algorithmic level.
  - Empirical methods (attacks, leakage estimation) provide insights but cannot formally guarantee DP.
  - Attacks on synthetic data show that strong privacy often reduces utility.

- **Utility & Fidelity Evaluation**:
  - Must be tailored to specific use cases (e.g., classification tasks, model selection).
  - Fidelity metrics gauge distributional similarity; utility metrics gauge task performance.
  - High fidelity does not always mean high utility for every task, and vice versa.

Overall, **no single metric** can capture all aspects of privacy, utility, and fidelity for synthetic data. Effective evaluation involves combining **formal guarantees** (when available) with **empirical tests** tailored to the intended application and threat model.

## Private Synthetic Data

**Summary**

This section focuses on **privacy issues unique to synthetic data**—particularly how generating data in the same space as the original dataset poses both **opportunities** (e.g., direct substitution for real data) and **challenges** (e.g., extremely high-dimensional outputs). The authors highlight the need to reason about privacy at the algorithmic level, emphasize the limits of releasing large, high-fidelity synthetic datasets, and explore several methodological approaches.

---

### 1. Key Observations for Private Synthetic Data

1. **High-Dimensionality**

   - Synthetic datasets often contain a large number of rows and columns, making the “output space” extremely high-dimensional.
   - Under differential privacy, such large outputs can inflate sensitivity, making it more difficult to achieve good utility without using a large privacy budget.

2. **Privacy is an Algorithmic Property**

   - Differential privacy concerns the _procedure_ that generates synthetic data, not the final dataset itself.
   - A single sample from the generator cannot be deemed “private” or “non-private” in isolation—only the algorithm can satisfy DP guarantees.

3. **Private Data vs. Private Generator**

   - Typically, one trains a **private generator** under DP, then samples as many synthetic records as needed. By the post-processing theorem, generating additional data does not further degrade the privacy guarantees.
   - However, **training a single DP model** to then generate large datasets often sacrifices utility, as the DP constraints limit how much information the generator can extract from the original data.

4. **Handling Outliers and Fairness**
   - DP-based methods struggle to represent outliers or minority groups because these are by definition unique data points and thus are more likely to be “hidden” or lost to protect privacy.
   - There is an inherent tension between retaining minority groups (fairness) and shielding sensitive individuals’ identities (privacy).

---

### 2. Existing Methods and Technologies

1. **Deep Learning Approaches**

   - **GANs and VAEs**: Adapted to satisfy DP using techniques like **DPSGD** (Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent) or **PATE** (Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles).
   - Careful placement of privacy (e.g., in the GAN discriminator vs. generator) can impact both the privacy budget and the fidelity of synthetic samples.

2. **Statistical / Low-Dimensional Models**

   - **Bayesian Networks**: Factorize the joint distribution into lower-dimensional conditional distributions.
   - **Copula Models**: Focus on correlation structures.
   - **Marginal-Based Approaches** (e.g., NIST competition winner): Differentially private estimation of all 2-way marginals, followed by sampling consistent synthetic data.

3. **Impossibility Results & Trade-Offs**
   - Theoretical work shows it’s infeasible to produce a single DP synthetic dataset preserving _all_ correlations and structure efficiently.
   - Practitioners therefore tailor which correlations matter most for a given use case (utility) and accept compromises in other aspects.

---

### 3. Partially Synthetic Data

1. **Definition**

   - Only the “sensitive” attributes are replaced with synthetic values; “quasi-identifiers” remain from the real dataset.
   - Often done via **multiple imputation** techniques (e.g., decision trees, random forests).

2. **Utility vs. Privacy**
   - Retaining real quasi-identifiers can improve utility (because the model only needs to learn the distribution of sensitive attributes conditioned on these identifiers).
   - However, it raises **privacy concerns** if quasi-identifiers are themselves sensitive or if they enable linkage attacks.
   - Few methods provide formal privacy guarantees, although **Label DP** has been proposed for this setting.

---

**Overall Takeaways**

- Generating **truly privacy-preserving synthetic data** is intrinsically hard due to the high-dimensional nature of full datasets and the need to protect sensitive outliers or minority groups.
- **No one-size-fits-all solution** exists: developers must carefully balance privacy budgets, utility goals, and fairness considerations.
- **Partially synthetic approaches** can be more tractable but may reveal quasi-identifiers, complicating privacy protections.
- **Advanced DP-based methods** (e.g., DPSGD, PATE) offer formal privacy but can reduce fidelity, especially for large or complex datasets.

## De-biased Synthetic Data Generation

**Summary**

This section examines how **synthetic data** can be used to **remove or mitigate biases** found in real-world training datasets. Whereas standard fairness methods typically modify or post-process trained models, **fair synthetic data** approaches aim to adjust the data before training. Below are the key points:

---

## 1. Motivation: Bias in Training Data

- **Machine learning models inherit biases** from their training data (e.g., historical discrimination in hiring).
- Correcting biases in already-trained models requires deep knowledge of the model internals and an understanding of different fairness metrics.
- **Synthetic data generation** for fairness attempts to produce data that has reduced or eliminated certain biases.

---

## 2. Fairness Notions

Fairness in ML is complex and can be defined in multiple ways, each requiring an identified set of **protected attributes** (e.g., race, gender).

1. **Fairness Through Unawareness (FTU)**

   - The protected attribute cannot directly be used by the predictor.
   - However, **indirect correlations** (where other features correlate with protected attributes) can still result in bias.

2. **Demographic Parity (DPa)**
   - A predictor’s outputs (e.g., job offers) should be **independent** of protected attributes.
   - Often enforced via **causal modeling** by removing edges or information that depend on protected attributes.
   - Can significantly hurt predictive performance since many correlated variables may be “contaminated” and must be dropped or altered.

---

## 3. Limitations of Fair Synthetic Data

1. **Distribution Shift**:
   - Even if a synthetic dataset is “fair,” a model trained on it may not remain fair when deployed on **real data**, because real-world feature distributions could differ from those in the synthetic data.
2. **Model-Specific Definitions**:
   - Fairness is typically assessed for a **specific predictor** trained on a given dataset; it does not necessarily generalize to all possible models that could be trained.
3. **Minority/Outlier Representation**:
   - Ensuring **protected groups** are adequately represented while also preserving overall utility can be challenging, given the inherent privacy and sampling constraints (see also discussion on outliers in Section 7).

---

## 4. Existing Fair Synthetic Data Methods

1. **Causal, GAN-Based Approaches**
   - Example: [23] constructs a **causal model** of the data and drops certain edges related to protected attributes to enforce fairness notions (like FTU or DPa).
   - The synthetic data generated has these biased causal pathways removed.
2. **GANs with Fairness Constraints**
   - Example: [22] adds a **fairness penalty** term to a GAN’s loss function. This trades off fidelity vs. fairness—if the model improves fidelity but reintroduces bias, it is penalized accordingly.

---

## 5. Evaluating Utility & Fidelity

- Much of the utility/fidelity assessment mirrors **Section 6.2** (e.g., Train-on-Synthetic-Test-on-Real).
- Additionally, **bias/fairness metrics** must be evaluated. For instance:
  - Whether the protected attributes correlate with model outputs.
  - Whether different demographic groups have similar error rates or outcomes.

---

### Key Takeaways

- **Fair synthetic data** can be an attractive alternative to per-model de-biasing because it creates a single adjusted dataset for multiple downstream tasks.
- **No universal notion of fairness**: The chosen fairness definition (e.g., FTU, DPa) dictates what data modifications are needed and what trade-offs must be made.
- **Practical Limitations**: Shifts between synthetic and real distributions, plus the complexity of multi-model usage, mean fair synthetic data may not guarantee fairness in all deployment scenarios.

## Data Augmentation

**Summary**

This section discusses **data augmentation** using synthetic data—one of the most successful and widely adopted applications of synthetic data in machine learning.

1. **Motivation and Context**

   - **Data augmentation** is often considered a form of semi-supervised learning, where synthetic examples are added to a real dataset to improve model training.
   - By increasing the effective size of a dataset, synthetic data can serve as a form of **regularization**, helping models generalize better and reducing overfitting.
   - Unlike domains such as **computer vision**, where straightforward transformations (e.g., flips, rotations) can generate new data, **generic tabular data** typically lacks similar structure, making synthetic generation more critical for augmentation.

2. **Basic Principle**

   - The goal is to improve model **generalization** by training on **real plus synthetic** data.
   - Crucially, **synthetic samples must be sufficiently different** from the real training data to offer new information rather than repeating what is already captured in the dataset.

3. **Methods and Techniques**
   - Any **generative model** that can produce realistic-yet-novel samples (e.g., GANs, VAEs) may be used for augmentation.
   - However, simply training a perfect generator (i.e., one that replicates the data distribution too closely) may not always boost performance. A certain “imperfection” or **diversity** in generated samples can be beneficial for improved robustness and generalization.
   - Researchers have proposed various **metrics** to measure diversity in synthetic data (e.g., the distribution-based scores in the GAN literature).

Overall, data augmentation with synthetic data is especially promising for **domains lacking natural transformations** (e.g., tabular datasets), where it can provide new, diverse samples that help models learn more robustly.

## Generative Modeling: An Overview

**Summary**

This text provides an overview of **generative modeling** methods and how they apply across various data types (tabular, time-series, images, audio, and video). It distinguishes **explicit density-based** and **implicit** generative models, examining popular architectures such as **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**, **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, and **Boltzmann Machines**. Below is a brief outline:

---

### 1. Generative Model Taxonomy

- **Explicit Models**: Define a tractable or approximate probability distribution; examples include VAEs and (Restricted) Boltzmann Machines.
- **Implicit Models**: Do not define a density directly but rather learn to **sample** from the target distribution. GANs are the primary example, with a generator-discriminator framework that achieves realistic outputs through adversarial training.

---

### 2. Data-Type-Specific Challenges

1. **Tabular Data**

   - Requires modeling multiple columns of varying data types (continuous, categorical) plus interdependencies.
   - Techniques include **Bayesian networks**, **Gaussian Copulas**, and **GAN-based** methods (with specialized handling of discrete variables).
   - Ensuring valid row-level semantics (e.g., no contradictory values) often requires additional constraints or post-processing.

2. **Time-Series Data**

   - Historically tackled by **autoregressive** models but challenged by non-stationarity and heavy-tailed distributions.
   - Modern methods often use **implicit modeling** (e.g., recurrent GANs) that condition future values on past data.
   - **Signature-based** approaches can reduce dimensionality, leveraging statistics of the path.

3. **Image Generation**

   - Early VAEs sometimes struggled to capture fine details due to pixel-wise loss functions.
   - **GANs** rapidly became a dominant approach, using semantic loss functions better aligned with human perception.
   - Techniques include **Conditional GANs (CGANs)**, **Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs)**, **Wasserstein GANs (WGANs)**, and more to improve stability and diversity (avoid mode collapse).

4. **Audio**

   - High temporal resolution demands efficient representations.
   - **WaveNets** (inspired by PixelRNN) directly model raw audio waveforms but can be computationally expensive.
   - Spectrogram-based methods trade off invertibility for reduced complexity.

5. **Video**
   - Viewed as sequences of images with significant inter-frame dependencies.
   - **Unconditional models** attempt to capture coherent objects and movement without external inputs.
   - **Conditional models** use text, audio, or future-frame forecasting tasks to guide video synthesis (e.g., video-to-video translation).

---

### 3. Key Observations & Challenges

- **Balancing Model Complexity and Stability**: Complex models (like GANs) can be powerful but risk training instability and mode collapse.
- **Handling Discrete Attributes**: For tabular data, transforming categorical columns into continuous distributions can lead to inaccuracies or complexity in generation.
- **Scalability**: Generating high-dimensional, multi-modal data (images, videos) requires careful architecture choices to manage training time and memory.
- **Quality vs. Diversity**: Improving realism can sometimes reduce variety in outputs (and vice versa), so advanced methods aim to balance these two aspects.

---

**Overall**, generative modeling has grown dramatically, driven by **GANs** and **VAEs** across many data modalities. While image synthesis is often the showcase, tabular, time-series, audio, and video data each introduce unique challenges requiring specialized architectures and post-processing to ensure **validity**, **stability**, and **quality** of the generated results.

## Messages from Industry/Start-ups

**Summary**

This section summarizes key insights from interviews with various **industry partners and start-ups** working on synthetic data, emphasizing both excitement and caution around the technology:

1. **Emerging Technology**

   - **AI Adoption is Still Maturing**: Organizations are only beginning to integrate advanced AI and ML solutions at scale, making synthetic data—an even newer concept—an area of ongoing research and interest.
   - **Heightened Privacy Demands**: Public concerns over data protection and regulatory pressures make privacy-focused technologies like synthetic data more appealing.

2. **Empirical Evaluations are Crucial**

   - While **differential privacy** provides a strong theoretical foundation, businesses require **practical demonstrations** of privacy defenses (e.g., resistance to real-world attacks).
   - Understanding how privacy parameters (ε, δ) map to **actual risk** is essential for confidence in private synthetic data solutions.

3. **Replacing Real Data?**

   - **Divided Opinions**:
     - Some believe synthetic data will **never fully replace** real data; the final stages of model development or fine-tuning likely require the original dataset for maximum accuracy.
     - Others suggest that, with enough research and methodological improvements, **fully synthetic** solutions could become feasible for many use cases.
   - **Theoretical Nuances**: Impossibility results (e.g., Ullman et al.) argue against universal general-use synthetic data, but relaxations (e.g., matching “most” correlations rather than all) hold promise for many practical scenarios.

4. **Enabling Power of Synthetic Data**
   - **Facilitates Collaboration**: Synthetic data can **circumvent legislative or cross-border data-sharing hurdles**, enabling more efficient collaboration or global deployment of ML models.
   - **Accelerates Development**: Teams can prototype and test models **earlier and more quickly** without waiting on complex data-sharing approvals.
   - Overall, synthetic data can **unlock potential** for broader data access and innovation while aiming to preserve individuals’ privacy.

In essence, industry players see **synthetic data** as a valuable tool to expedite development and handle privacy challenges, but they acknowledge that it may not always supersede real data for final model training. The key is striking the right balance between **practical utility** and **robust privacy**.
