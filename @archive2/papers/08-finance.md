## Generating synthetic data in finance: opportunities, challenges and pitfalls

Assefa

The paper "Generating synthetic data in finance: opportunities, challenges and pitfalls" provides several key insights into the use of synthetic data in the financial sector:

## Motivation and Use Cases

1. Synthetic data generation in finance is driven by several factors:

- Internal data use restrictions due to regulatory requirements
- Lack of historical data for rare events like market crashes
- Need to address class imbalance issues in fraud detection
- Enabling training of advanced machine learning models without exposing sensitive data
- Facilitating data sharing between institutions and researchers while maintaining privacy

## Types of Financial Data

2. The paper focuses on two main types of financial data:

- Retail banking data: Typically tabular data including transaction records, loan applications, etc.
- Market microstructure data: Time series data representing limit order books and market dynamics

## Techniques for Synthetic Data Generation

3. For tabular data, various methods are discussed, including:

- Differential privacy-based approaches
- Bayesian network models
- Copula-based methods
- Agent-based modeling

4. For time series data, approaches include:

- Statistical models (e.g., GARCH)
- Neural network-based methods (e.g., QuantGAN)
- Agent-based models simulating market dynamics

## Challenges and Considerations

5. Privacy preservation is a critical concern, with differential privacy emerging as a popular technical solution for tabular data.

6. Evaluating the quality of synthetic data remains an open challenge, particularly for high-dimensional financial time series.

7. Representing synthetic data in a compact, human-readable, and privacy-preserving format is an important area for future research.

## Future Directions

8. The paper calls for:

- Development of standardized metrics and benchmarks for evaluating synthetic financial data
- Further research into privacy-preserving methods for time series data
- Creation of a shared vocabulary and context for generating synthetic financial data

9. The authors emphasize the importance of balancing privacy protection with data utility, highlighting the need for tunable parameters in synthetic data generation methods.

In conclusion, while synthetic data offers significant potential for the financial sector, there are still many challenges to overcome in terms of data quality, privacy preservation, and evaluation methodologies.
