## 2. Create an Evaluation Framework

Use the following categories to structure your vendor comparisons:

### A. Data Fidelity & Utility

- **Statistical Similarity**:
  - Does the synthetic data preserve important statistical properties (distributions, correlations, outliers) of the real data?
  - Do they offer metrics (e.g., Jensen–Shannon divergence, correlation comparisons, feature importance tests) to gauge fidelity?
- **Model Performance**:
  - How do machine learning models trained on (or tested with) the synthetic data perform compared to those trained on real data?
  - Request or conduct a proof-of-concept (PoC) to measure any drop-off in model accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

### B. Privacy & Security

- **Privacy Guarantees**:
  - Does the tool provide formal privacy measures (e.g., differential privacy)?
  - How do they prevent re-identification or leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI)?
- **Data Handling**:
  - For on-prem solutions, confirm that no real data is ever sent to the vendor or a third-party cloud environment.
  - If there’s a “phoning home” or usage-metering requirement, what exactly is transmitted? Is it encrypted? Is it anonymized?
- **Certifications & Compliance**:
  - Does the vendor have relevant certifications (e.g., SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001)?
  - Are they able to provide documentation on HIPAA or other compliance frameworks?

### C. Deployment & Integration

- **Deployment Options**:
  - On-prem software, containerized solution (Docker, Kubernetes), private cloud, or fully managed SaaS?
  - How do these match your IT and security constraints?
- **Integration with Existing Workflows**:
  - Can the tool connect to your data sources (databases, data lakes, etc.) easily?
  - Does it offer APIs or SDKs for automation within your existing data pipelines (e.g., Python libraries, CLI tools, etc.)?
- **Performance & Scalability**:
  - How quickly can it generate synthetic data at the volume you need?
  - Does it handle large, high-dimensional datasets efficiently?

### D. Usability & Features

- **User Interface & Ease of Use**:
  - Is there a GUI for non-technical users?
  - Are there advanced configuration options for data scientists who need fine control?
- **Data Exploration & Visualization Tools**:
  - Does the platform help you compare real vs. synthetic distributions visually?
  - Does it offer data profiling or summary statistics?
- **Specialized Features**:
  - Time-series synthesis, text synthesis, image synthesis, or domain-specific transformations for insurance data (e.g., claim sequences).

### E. Vendor Expertise & Support

- **Domain Knowledge**:
  - Has the vendor worked with insurance companies before?
  - Can they share case studies or references?
- **Support & Training**:
  - Do they offer implementation guidance, training sessions, or dedicated support?
  - Are there professional services to help with complex setups or custom needs?
- **Roadmap & Innovation**:
  - Does the vendor have a clear product roadmap?
  - Are they actively investing in R&D to improve synthetic data fidelity and privacy techniques?

### F. Pricing & Licensing

- **Licensing Model**:
  - Usage-based, seat-based, capacity-based, or enterprise license?
  - What are the potential overage costs if you exceed usage?
- **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**:
  - Implementation, configuration, hardware, ongoing support, etc.
  - Are there hidden costs for feature add-ons, advanced modules, or premium support?
