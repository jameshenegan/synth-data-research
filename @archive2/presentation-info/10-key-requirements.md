## 1. Identify Your Key Requirements

Before you dive into specific vendors, clarify your organization’s needs and constraints:

1. **Use Cases**: Are you generating synthetic data for:

   - Model development and prototyping?
   - Testing/QA in lower environments?
   - Sharing data with external partners?
   - Offloading real data from analytics pipelines for privacy reasons?

2. **Data Types**:

   - Structured (tabular) data, text, images, geolocation data, etc.
   - Insurance datasets might include policy data, claims data, medical codes, etc.

3. **Scale & Performance**:

   - How large are your datasets (rows, columns, complexity)?
   - How often do you need to synthesize them?
   - Do you need real-time or batch generation?

4. **On-Prem vs. Cloud**:

   - Confirm if your security policies or data governance require all data processing to be on-prem.
   - Check if you can use a hybrid approach (partial on-prem, partial cloud).

5. **Privacy & Compliance**:

   - HIPAA, GLBA, state insurance regulators, internal governance, etc.
   - What level of “privacy guarantee” do you need? (E.g., differential privacy, k-anonymity, etc.)

6. **Budget & Licensing Model**:
   - What licensing structures are acceptable (seat-based, volume-based, flat fee, usage-based)?
   - Does your security policy allow for usage metrics to be transmitted outside your network?
