## 4. Privacy and Legal Considerations

**4.1 Privacy Trade-Off**

- Explain the relationship between data fidelity/utility and privacy.
- Introduce concepts like **differential privacy** and other anonymization techniques.

**4.2 Regulatory Environment**

- Relevant laws and regulations (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, etc.)
- How synthetic data may help or may still require caution.

**4.3 Academic Perspective**

- Reference key academic papers that discuss the limitations or challenges of synthetic data.
- Highlight the “still developing” aspect of the field.

### Tips for Delivering the Presentation

1. **Balance Depth and Accessibility**
   - Tailor the technical details (GANs, VAEs) to the audience’s level of familiarity with ML/AI.
2. **Highlight the “So What?”**
   - Explain why each point matters to your organization (e.g., privacy regulations, cost savings, better test data).
3. **Use Visuals and Real Examples**
   - Charts, diagrams, or short demos can help clarify complex methods or product differentiators.
4. **Maintain Neutrality**
   - Focus on presenting facts rather than endorsing any single vendor.
   - Clarify which claims come from vendors vs. which come from academic research.
5. **Encourage Discussion**
   - Leave time for Q&A, especially around feasibility, costs, and next steps.
