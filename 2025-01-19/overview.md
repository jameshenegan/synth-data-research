## Question

I'm interested about the "installation process" of the products offered by these companies. In particular, I'd like to know about whether their solutions can be set up in such a way that my data stays on premises. I don't want to send my data up to the cloud.

## Response

Based on the search results, several companies offer on-premises deployment options that allow you to keep your data within your own infrastructure. Here's an overview of the installation processes and on-premises capabilities for some key providers:

## MOSTLY AI

MOSTLY AI offers on-premises deployment options:

- Can be deployed on Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters within your own environment[7]
- Supports air-gapped environments, ensuring no data leaves your secure infrastructure[35]
- Provides a Helm chart for easy deployment on Kubernetes clusters[23]

## Gretel.ai

Gretel offers a hybrid deployment model:

- Gretel Hybrid operates within your own cloud tenant[30]
- Deployed on Kubernetes in GCP, Azure, or AWS
- Customer data never leaves your cloud environment
- Interfaces with Gretel's Control Plane API for job scheduling, but keeps data within your infrastructure

## Tonic.ai

Tonic provides self-hosted deployment options:

- Can be deployed using Docker or Kubernetes[31][25]
- Offers on-premises installation to keep data within your environment[37]
- Provides administrator tools for monitoring and user management in self-hosted instances

## K2View

K2View supports on-premises and hybrid deployments:

- Can be installed on-premises or in a hybrid (on-premise + cloud) configuration[39]
- Offers flexibility in deployment options to keep data within your infrastructure

## General Installation Process

While specific steps vary by provider, the general process for on-premises installations often includes:

1. Preparing the environment (e.g., setting up Kubernetes or Docker)
2. Downloading installation files or accessing provided repositories
3. Configuring deployment settings
4. Running installation scripts or commands (often using tools like Helm for Kubernetes deployments)
5. Verifying the installation and configuring initial settings

It's important to note that these solutions are designed to operate within your own infrastructure, allowing you to maintain control over your data and comply with data residency requirements.

## Question

I'm also interested in how much this would all cost. Suppose I had a lot of data that I wanted to synthesize. I get the impression that some of these companies offer their products on a "credit system" --- where the amount it costs depends on how much data I want to synthesize. But I don't really understand why they have set it up that way --- particularly if I have it set up so that all my data is on premises. I also don't understand HOW it is set up that way --- how do they keep track of how much data I synthesize if all of my data stays on premises

Many synthetic data companies use a credit-based pricing model, which can be confusing, especially for on-premises deployments. Let's break down how this typically works and why companies might choose this model:

## Credit-Based Pricing Model

Several companies in the synthetic data space, including MOSTLY AI, Gretel.ai, and Tonic.ai, use credit-based pricing. Here's how it generally works:

1. Credits are typically tied to a unit of data generation, such as:

   - Number of synthetic records generated
   - Amount of data processed (e.g., rows, characters)
   - Compute time used for data generation

2. Pricing tiers often include a certain number of credits, with additional credits available for purchase.

For example:

- MOSTLY AI offers 5 free daily credits, with 1 credit equaling 1 million synthetic data points[1].
- Gretel.ai provides 15 free monthly credits, with 1 credit equal to 100,000 characters for their inference API[22].

## Rationale Behind Credit-Based Pricing

Companies may use this model for several reasons:

1. **Scalability**: It allows customers to pay for what they use, scaling costs with usage.
2. **Flexibility**: Customers can choose plans based on their expected data needs.
3. **Predictability**: It provides a clear metric for cost estimation.

## On-Premises Tracking

For on-premises deployments, companies typically use one of these methods to track usage:

1. **Software-based metering**: The synthetic data generation software includes usage tracking capabilities that report back to the vendor.

2. **API-based tracking**: If the software makes API calls to external services (even for licensing or updates), usage data can be transmitted.

3. **Manual reporting**: Some vendors may require periodic manual reporting of usage metrics.

4. **Auditing**: Vendors might include the right to audit usage in their contracts.

It's worth noting that some companies, like K2view, offer alternative pricing models. K2view, for instance, doesn't publicly disclose their pricing structure, suggesting they might use a more traditional enterprise software pricing model[40].

## Cost Considerations

Actual costs can vary significantly based on your data volume and use case. For example:

- Tonic.ai's pricing starts at $10,000 annually for their Structural product[18].
- Gretel.ai's Team plan starts at $295 per month plus $2.20 per additional credit[37].

For large-scale enterprise use, costs can be much higher. For instance, AWS Marketplace lists Gretel Synthetic Data Platform's enterprise plan starting at $66,000 for a 12-month contract[32].

## Alternatives to Credit-Based Pricing

Some companies offer alternative pricing models:

- Fixed-fee licensing
- Usage-based pricing without credits (e.g., based on data volume or compute resources)
- Custom enterprise pricing

When evaluating synthetic data solutions, especially for on-premises deployments, it's crucial to discuss pricing models with vendors directly. You may be able to negotiate a pricing structure that better aligns with your specific use case and data volume.
