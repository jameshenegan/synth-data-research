## Question 11

I am curious about working installation and deployment, particularly the topic of "on-prem" versus "in the cloud". Can this company's products work "on prem"? Can it work "in the cloud"?

## Response

Based on the available information, Dedomena's products can work both "on-prem" (on-premises) and "in the cloud," offering flexibility to meet different customer needs and deployment preferences.

## On-Premises Deployment

Dedomena supports on-premises deployment of their synthetic data generation platform:

- The company offers an on-premise option where their solution runs on the customer's own servers and is fully managed by the customer's team[1].
- This deployment model is not shared with other customers, providing exclusive control and privacy[1].
- On-premises deployment is ideal for organizations with strict regulatory compliance requirements or those needing to keep sensitive data within their own infrastructure[1].

## Cloud Deployment

Dedomena also provides cloud-based deployment options:

- The company supports various cloud infrastructures, including AWS, GCP, Azure, MS SQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL[1].
- Cloud deployment allows for easier scalability and reduced infrastructure management overhead for customers.
- Dedomena offers a SaaS (Software as a Service) version of their platform, which launched globally in 2023[2].

## Hybrid Approach

Dedomena's platform appears to be flexible enough to accommodate hybrid deployment scenarios:

- Customers can choose to run certain components on-premises while leveraging cloud resources for others, depending on their specific needs and data sensitivity requirements.

## Key Considerations

When deciding between on-premises and cloud deployments, organizations should consider:

1. Data Security: On-premises deployment offers more direct control over data, which may be crucial for highly sensitive information.
2. Compliance: Some industries may require on-premises solutions to meet specific regulatory requirements.
3. Scalability: Cloud deployments generally offer easier scalability.
4. Cost: On-premises solutions often involve higher upfront costs but may be more cost-effective long-term for certain use cases.
5. Maintenance: Cloud solutions typically require less maintenance from the customer's IT team.

Dedomena's ability to support both on-premises and cloud deployments provides customers with the flexibility to choose the model that best fits their specific needs, security requirements, and infrastructure preferences.
