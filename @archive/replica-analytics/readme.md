## Question 4

Is this company able to generate synthetic data based off of unstructed data (e.g., PDF files, Word Documents)

## Response

Based on the available information, Replica Analytics (now part of Aetion and rebranded as Aetion® Generate) primarily focuses on generating synthetic data from structured, tabular data sources, particularly in the healthcare industry. There is no explicit mention of their ability to generate synthetic data from unstructured data sources like PDF files or Word documents.

## Capabilities

- Aetion® Generate specializes in creating privacy-enhancing synthetic data from real-world data (RWD), randomized controlled trials (RCT), and other structured data sources[4].
- The technology is designed to assess, synthesize, and enhance utility of real-world and clinical data[4].

## Limitations

- The search results do not provide any information about Replica Analytics or Aetion® Generate working directly with unstructured data like PDFs or Word documents.
- The focus appears to be on tabular, structured data typically found in healthcare databases and clinical trials.

## Potential Workarounds

While Replica Analytics may not directly handle unstructured data, it's possible to use a two-step process to achieve similar results:

1. **Data Extraction**: Use other tools to extract structured data from unstructured sources. For example, Amazon Textract can be used to extract information from PDF files and convert it into structured formats[2].

2. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Once the data is in a structured format, it could potentially be used as input for Aetion® Generate to create synthetic versions.

However, it's important to note that this approach is speculative and not explicitly mentioned in the provided information about Replica Analytics or Aetion® Generate.

In conclusion, while Replica Analytics offers powerful synthetic data generation capabilities for structured data, there is no clear evidence that they directly support unstructured data sources like PDF files or Word documents.
