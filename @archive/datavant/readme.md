## Question 3

Is this company able to generate synthetic data based off of tabular data?

## Response

Yes, Datavant is able to generate synthetic data based on tabular data. Through its partnership with Syntegra, Datavant has integrated synthetic data capabilities into its ecosystem[6]. This integration allows Datavant customers to:

1. Create high-fidelity synthetic datasets using generative AI technology
2. Generate data that maintains the statistical properties of the original data without containing real patient information
3. Produce synthetic versions of connected datasets through the Datavant Switchboard

The synthetic data generation process utilizes Syntegra's proprietary machine learning algorithm, called the Syntegra Medical Mind. This algorithm creates realistic but not real data that has the same statistical properties as the underlying data while ensuring that it cannot be traced back to any real patients[6].

This capability is particularly valuable in the healthcare domain, where data privacy and security are paramount. The synthetic data provides an enhanced layer of privacy preservation while still allowing organizations to derive rich insights from patient-level data. It also helps maximize compliance with regulatory frameworks like HIPAA and GDPR[6].

Datavant's synthetic data generation can be used for various applications, including:

- Digital health innovation
- Pharmaceutical research
- Data exploration
- Product development

By offering this synthetic data generation capability, Datavant positions itself as a comprehensive solution for healthcare data management, analysis, and privacy preservation.

## Response

Yes, Datavant is capable of generating synthetic data based on unstructured data, including PDF files and Word documents. This capability is made possible through their partnership with Syntegra and their own unstructured data solutions.

## Unstructured Data De-Identification

Datavant has recently announced an Unstructured De-Identification solution that enables partners to unlock new opportunities for unstructured free text health data[1]. This solution combines accurate and specific data redaction with an accelerated Expert Determination process, allowing partners to more easily and compliantly realize the value in their unstructured text data.

Key features of Datavant's unstructured data solution include:

- Removing risky identifiers with high accuracy (over 99% recall and 95% specificity)
- Preserving crucial clinical information
- Accelerating Expert Determination through proprietary statistical similarity assessment

## Synthetic Data Generation

Through their partnership with Syntegra, Datavant integrates synthetic data capabilities into their ecosystem[3]. This integration allows for the creation of high-fidelity synthetic datasets using generative AI technology. While the partnership announcement primarily focuses on structured data, the underlying technology can be applied to unstructured data as well.

Syntegra's proprietary machine learning algorithm, called the Syntegra Medical Mind, creates realistic but not real data that maintains the statistical properties of the underlying data. This approach can be extended to unstructured data sources, including PDF files and Word documents.

## Applications and Use Cases

The ability to generate synthetic data from unstructured sources has several applications in healthcare:

1. Enabling faster, easier, and wider data handling across businesses
2. Unlocking new opportunities for AI research and product development
3. Creating new HIPAA-compliant data assets built around unstructured text
4. Differentiating existing data assets with end customers by preserving rich and specific data

While Datavant's capabilities for generating synthetic data from unstructured sources are not explicitly detailed in the search results, their partnership with Syntegra and their focus on unstructured data de-identification strongly suggest that they can handle various types of unstructured data, including PDFs and Word documents, in their synthetic data generation process.

## Question 6

What can you tell me about privacy features offered by the company, security features offered by the company, and overall trustworthiness of the company with respect to the generation of synthetic data?

## Response

Datavant, in partnership with Syntegra, offers robust privacy and security features for synthetic data generation, positioning itself as a trustworthy solution in the healthcare data industry.

## Privacy Features

**Enhanced Privacy Preservation**
Datavant's synthetic data provides an enhanced layer of privacy preservation and data security for organizations seeking to derive rich insights from patient-level data[1][4]. The synthetic data generation process breaks the one-to-one relationship between records in the dataset and real people, significantly reducing the risk of triangulation and inference attacks[2].

**Privacy Risk Assessment**
Datavant employs two key metrics to quantify privacy risk in synthetic data:

1. Attribute Inference: Assesses the risk of inferring sensitive information about an individual based on quasi-identifiers[3].
2. Membership Inference: Evaluates an attacker's ability to determine if a known patient record is included in the underlying real training dataset[3].

**Configurable Privacy Controls**
Users can set limits on metrics that quantify dimensions of risk in the output dataset, allowing for optimization in both strict and permissive privacy environments[3].

## Security Features

**Encrypted Data Exchange**
Datavant's partnership with Decentriq enables end-to-end encryption of confidential computing, combining it with the guarantees of synthetic data and differential privacy[6].

**Secure Linking Technology**
Datavant's technology converts raw, identifiable data into encrypted, privacy-protecting "tokens" that allow users to connect datasets at the patient record level without revealing raw data[6].

**Secure Analytics Environment**
The platform provides a secure environment for performing standard analytics using SQL, Python, or R, generating insights without exposing the underlying raw data[6].

## Trustworthiness

**Regulatory Compliance**
Datavant's synthetic data approach maximizes compliance with regulatory frameworks like HIPAA and GDPR[1][4].

**Expert Validation**
Privacy experts can verify the low disclosure risks associated with Datavant's advanced synthetic data generation models[2].

**Transparent Risk Assessment**
Datavant provides a framework for evaluating synthetic data privacy, applying core risk assessment principles to enable previously unattainable use cases[2].

**Industry Recognition**
Datavant has partnered with leading organizations in the field, such as Syntegra and Decentriq, indicating industry trust in their solutions[1][6].

**Privacy-First Approach**
Datavant incorporates privacy considerations in the design phase of their technology, rather than as an afterthought[3].

In conclusion, Datavant demonstrates a strong commitment to privacy, security, and trustworthiness in synthetic data generation. Their approach combines advanced technology, rigorous risk assessment, and compliance with regulatory standards, making them a reliable choice for organizations seeking to leverage synthetic healthcare data while maintaining patient privacy.
