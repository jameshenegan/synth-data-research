Is this company able to generate synthetic data based off of tabular data?
```

Yes, Hazy is capable of generating synthetic data based on tabular data. The company specializes in creating synthetic data from structured, tabular, and relational data sources[1][5].

## Key Features

**Sample-Based Generation:** Hazy's synthetic data is generated based on a statistical analysis of a source dataset, which must be in tabular or relational form[1].

**Multi-Column and Multi-Table Support:** The platform can model relationships between columns and handle data extracted from multiple tables while preserving referential integrity[1].

**Wide Range of Data Types:** Hazy supports over 50 data types, allowing for the generation of diverse tabular datasets[1].

**Complex Data Modeling:** The system can handle multi-column distributions, sequential data, and complex business logic, ensuring that the synthetic data accurately reflects the patterns and correlations of the original tabular data[1][5].

## Process

1. Data Ingestion: The source tabular data is ingested into the Hazy system.
2. Data Processing: Necessary transformations are applied to prepare the data for analysis.
3. Generator Training: A Generator is trained to learn the patterns and correlations in the source data.
4. Synthetic Data Creation: New data is generated by sampling from the trained Generator, maintaining the statistical properties of the original tabular data[1].

Hazy's approach to synthetic data generation makes it particularly useful for enterprises dealing with complex and regulated datasets, allowing them to create realistic tabular data for various applications such as software testing, AI development, and business intelligence[2][5].
