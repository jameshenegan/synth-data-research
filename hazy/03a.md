What can you tell me about the methods this company uses to generate synthetic data off of tabular data?
```

Hazy employs advanced machine learning techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data from tabular sources. Their approach involves several key methods and features:

## Sample-Based Generation

Hazy uses a sample-based generation process that involves:

1. Data Ingestion: The source tabular data is ingested into the Hazy system.
2. Data Processing: Necessary transformations are applied to prepare the data for analysis.
3. Generator Training: A Generator is trained to learn the patterns and correlations in the source data.
4. Synthetic Data Creation: New data is generated by sampling from the trained Generator, maintaining the statistical properties of the original tabular data[1].

## Advanced Modeling Techniques

Hazy utilizes various advanced modeling techniques to generate synthetic data:

- **Generative AI**: The platform employs machine learning algorithms to create realistic synthetic data that closely resembles the original dataset[3].
- **Multi-column distributions**: Hazy models not only the distributions of single columns but also the relationships between columns[1].
- **Complex Data Modeling**: The system can handle multi-column distributions, sequential data, and complex business logic[1].

## Privacy and Security Features

- **Differential Privacy**: Hazy incorporates differential privacy techniques to enhance privacy guarantees[1].
- **Outlier Handling**: The system applies "noise" to the data and can "cut out" outlier data points when applying disclosure risk thresholds[1].

## Support for Multiple Data Types

Hazy supports over 50 data types, allowing for the generation of diverse tabular datasets. This includes handling of:

- Continuous data columns
- ID formats
- Categorical data (e.g., gender, location)
- Sequential data[1]

## Business Logic Integration

Hazy allows for the integration of complex business logic into the synthetic data generation process:

- User-defined formulas for continuous data columns
- Min/max bounds setting
- Entity assignment (e.g., people, locations, categories) to ensure coherent data production[1]

By combining these methods, Hazy is able to generate synthetic tabular data that maintains the statistical properties, relationships, and business logic of the original data while ensuring privacy and security.
