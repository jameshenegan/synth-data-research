While Hazy does not publicly disclose detailed pricing information, some insights into their pricing structure can be gleaned from the available information:

## Pricing Model

Hazy employs a scalable pricing model based on a simple product structure[5][8]. This model is designed to accommodate a range of deployment sizes, from single table to enterprise-wide implementations.

## Pricing Plans

**Custom Quotes:** Hazy primarily offers custom pricing quotes tailored to each client's specific needs and usage requirements[2]. Interested buyers are encouraged to contact Hazy directly for personalized pricing information.

**Factors Affecting Price:** The actual cost for a client likely depends on several factors, including:

- The size of the database
- The number of data subjects (rows)
- The number of data points per subject (columns)
- The number of users (creators)

## Market Positioning

Hazy's pricing strategy appears to be geared towards enterprise clients, particularly those in sectors with strict privacy regulations such as banking, healthcare, and finance[2]. This suggests that their pricing may be at a premium level, reflecting the advanced capabilities and enterprise-grade features of their synthetic data platform.

## Accessibility

- Hazy's solutions are now available on the AWS Marketplace, potentially offering an additional purchasing avenue for interested organizations[6].
- The company has recently been acquired by SAS, which may lead to changes or integrations in their pricing structure in the future[3].

It's important to note that for the most accurate and up-to-date pricing information, potential customers should contact Hazy directly, as the company does not publicly advertise its rates on its website[2].
