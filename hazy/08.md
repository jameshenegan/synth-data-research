- Founded by Harry Keen, James Arthur, and Dr. Luke Robinson[1]
- Initially incubated by Post Urban Ventures and CyLon in 2017[1]
- Raised Â£340,000 pre-seed funding in October 2017, led by UCL Technology Fund[1]
- Was the first company to take synthetic data to market as a viable enterprise product[6]

Since its founding, Hazy has grown significantly:

- Won the $1 million Microsoft Innovate AI prize for best AI startup in Europe[1]
- Raised $9 million in Series A funding in March 2023[3]
- Recently acquired by SAS in November 2024 to enhance SAS's data and AI portfolio[4]
