## Question

Is this company able to generate synthetic data based off of unstructed data (e.g., PDF files, Word Documents)

## Response

Based on the available information, Hazy primarily focuses on generating synthetic data from structured, tabular data sources rather than unstructured data like PDF files or Word documents.

## Hazy's Data Focus

Hazy specializes in creating synthetic data from structured data formats:

- The company generates sample-based synthetic data based on statistical analysis of source datasets in tabular or relational form.
- Hazy supports over 50 data types, allowing for the generation of diverse tabular datasets.
- Their system can handle multi-column distributions, sequential data, and complex business logic within structured data.

## Limitations for Unstructured Data

There is no indication that Hazy currently offers solutions for generating synthetic data from unstructured sources like PDFs or Word documents. Their core capabilities revolve around:

- Ingesting structured data from files or databases
- Analyzing and modeling tabular data relationships
- Generating synthetic data that maintains the statistical properties of the original structured data

While Hazy's technology is advanced in handling complex tabular data, including multiple tables with referential integrity, it does not appear to extend to unstructured document processing.

For organizations looking to work with unstructured data for synthetic data generation or AI training, other specialized tools may be more appropriate. For example, solutions like Tonic Textual are designed specifically to handle unstructured documents for AI development and LLM training purposes.
