## Question

What can you tell me about privacy features offered by the company, security features offered by the company, and overall trustworthiness of the company with respect to the generation of synthetic data?

## Response

Hazy offers robust privacy and security features in their synthetic data generation platform, positioning themselves as a trustworthy solution for organizations dealing with sensitive data. Here's an overview of their key offerings:

## Privacy Features

**Differential Privacy**
Hazy incorporates differential privacy into their synthetic data generation process, which provides mathematical guarantees to minimize the influence of any individual's data on the trained generator[1][6]. This significantly lowers the risk of re-identification and meets criteria for anonymous data as defined by ICO guidelines[9].

**Disclosure Risk Assessment**
The platform evaluates synthetic data using multiple privacy metrics:

- Presence Disclosure Risk: Measures the ability to infer whether a data point was in the training set[2].
- Density Disclosure Risk: Estimates the risk of mapping synthetic data points to real data points[2].
- Distance to Closest Record: Detects overfitting or memorization of real data points[2].

**No Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**
Hazy synthetic data removes all PII from source data while preserving statistical properties[7].

## Security Features

**Deployment Options**
Hazy can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud next to source data, ensuring that no data leaves the client's environment[3].

**Access Controls**
The platform offers customizable roles and permission sets to control data access[3].

**Audit Trails**
Hazy provides downloadable audit logs and data controller sign-off capabilities for compliance purposes[3].

**Compliance**
The platform includes built-in checks to ensure generated synthetic data is compliant with data protection laws[3].

## Trustworthiness

**Industry Recognition**
Hazy has been recognized for its accurate reproduction of data characteristics, particularly in financial services[5].

**Acquisition by SAS**
The recent acquisition by SAS, a leader in analytics, underscores Hazy's credibility in the field[4].

**Transparency**
Hazy provides extensive documentation on their privacy approaches and metrics, demonstrating a commitment to transparency[1][2].

**Expert Development**
The company emphasizes that their expert team has spent years developing and refining their generative models to ensure privacy[3].

**ICO Recommendation**
Hazy's approach aligns with the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) guidelines on anonymization and privacy-enhancing technologies[9].

In conclusion, Hazy demonstrates a strong commitment to privacy and security in synthetic data generation, with features that address both technical and compliance aspects. Their acquisition by SAS and alignment with regulatory guidelines further enhance their trustworthiness in handling sensitive data for synthetic generation.
