# 2. Short Definition and History

**Slide Title:** _What Is Synthetic Data? A Brief History_

- **Definition**

  - _Synthetic data_ is **artificially generated** by purpose-built algorithms or models, **mimicking** real data’s statistical properties.
  - Contrasts with _real data_, which is collected from actual events or transactions.

- **Historical Roots**
  - Dates back to **Monte Carlo methods (1940s)** for simulation.
  - Gained traction in the **1990s** with Donald Rubin & Roderick Little’s work on _multiple imputation_ for privacy.
  - Used by government agencies (e.g., U.S. Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Census Bureau) to release public-use datasets with minimal re-identification risk.

**Key Point:** Synthetic data helps solve data scarcity, privacy, and compliance challenges while still enabling robust analysis and experimentation.

# 3. What Is Synthetic Data? (Detailed Overview)

**Slide Title:** _Deep Dive: Synthetic Data_

1. **Core Idea**

   - Artificial generation of data via statistical or machine learning models (e.g., GANs, agent-based simulations).
   - Preserves distributions and relationships _without_ referencing actual individuals.

2. **Why It Matters**

   - **Privacy-Preserving**: Limits personal data exposure.
   - **Versatile**: Fills data gaps, tests edge cases, accelerates collaboration.
   - **Historical Use**: Earliest approaches in flight simulators, risk modeling, official statistics.

3. **Modern Approaches**
   - **Statistical/Model-Based**: Regression/imputation, Bayesian networks, copulas.
   - **ML-Driven**: GANs, VAEs for complex data types (images, text, tabular).

---

# 4. Use Cases of Synthetic Data

**Slide Title:** _Top Use Cases_

1. **Private Synthetic Data**

   - Regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA).
   - Enables _data sharing_ and _collaboration_ without personal identifiers.

2. **Debiasing**

   - Correct or rebalance unwanted biases (e.g., gender, race, historical inequities).
   - Useful for fairness in AI systems.

3. **Data Augmentation**
   - Expand scarce datasets with realistic samples.
   - Improve model performance on rare or edge cases.
   - Example: Fraud detection, rare diseases in healthcare.

# 5. Challenges

**Slide Title:** _Key Challenges in Synthetic Data_

- **Data Quality vs. Privacy Trade-Off**

  - Strong privacy measures (e.g., differential privacy) can _distort_ data, lowering utility.

- **Embedded Bias**

  - Models can inadvertently replicate and reinforce biases from the real dataset.

- **Overfitting & Leakage**

  - Generative models risk memorizing real data, re-introducing privacy risks.

- **Utility Validation**

  - Synthetic data may omit edge cases or anomalies critical for real-world analysis.

- **Complex Structures**
  - Relational, time-series, or multi-dimensional data can be challenging to synthesize while preserving integrity.

---

# 6. The Concept of Privacy in Relation to Synthetic Data

**Slide Title:** _Privacy: The Cornerstone_

- **Privacy Drivers**

  - Growing regulations: GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, etc.
  - Avoiding re-identification attacks (membership inference, attribute inference).

- **Differential Privacy (DP)**

  - _Formal framework_: Ensures minimal change in output if any single individual is removed from the dataset.
  - **Trade-Off**: Stronger DP \(\rightarrow\) lower fidelity.

- **Challenges**
  - Hard to guarantee privacy if the model “memorizes” real records.
  - Official seals (like DP) require rigorous algorithmic proofs, not just empirical testing.

---

# 7. Utility, Fidelity, and Privacy: A Three-Way Relationship

**Slide Title:** _Balancing the Three Pillars_

1. **Utility**

   - How well synthetic data supports specific tasks (model training, analytics).

2. **Fidelity**

   - Statistical similarity to real data (distributions, correlations).

3. **Privacy**
   - Minimizing re-identification risk or leakage of sensitive details.

**Key Insight:**

- Higher **fidelity** often means lower **privacy**.
- Achieving _useful_ synthetic data requires carefully navigating these **trade-offs**.

---

# 8. Overview of Private Synthetic Data

**Slide Title:** _Private Synthetic Data 101_

- **Definition**

  - Synthetic data _explicitly_ designed to protect PII or PHI, often using formal privacy (differential privacy).

- **Why It’s Hard**

  - High-dimensional data amplifies privacy leakage risk.
  - Sensitive outliers or minority groups can be “lost” or “exposed.”

- **Methods**

  - **DP-GANs, DP-VAEs**: Add noise to training.
  - **Marginal Approaches**: Ensure privacy in sub-distributions.

- **Applications**
  - Sharing data with partners or vendors under strict compliance.
  - Government agencies releasing population microdata.

---

# 9. Overview of Debiasing

**Slide Title:** _Debiasing with Synthetic Data_

- **Rationale**

  - Historical data can reflect past discrimination or unrepresentative samples.
  - Biased datasets \(\rightarrow\) biased ML models.

- **Synthetic Data Approach**

  - Remove or rebalance sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender).
  - _Causal approaches_: Adjust generative models to eliminate harmful correlations.

- **Limitations**
  - Distribution shift between synthetic and real deployment scenarios.
  - Fairness definitions vary (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds).

---

# 10. Overview of Augmentation

**Slide Title:** _Data Augmentation_

- **Primary Goal**

  - Increase dataset size and diversity.
  - Strengthen ML models, reduce overfitting.

- **Methods**

  - Generative adversarial networks for tabular or image data.
  - Synthetic oversampling for minority classes (fraud, rare diseases).

- **Success Stories**
  - Autonomous vehicle simulations.
  - Synthetic patient records in healthcare to handle rare pathologies.
