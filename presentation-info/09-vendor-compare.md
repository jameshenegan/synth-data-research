- **If your focus is specifically on synthetic data fidelity and open-source customization**, **MOSTLY AI** and **Gretel** both offer SDKs and a developer-centric approach.
- **If you want rapid dev/test data provisioning and ephemeral environments**, **Tonic.ai** specializes in that domain with strong integrations and privacy controls.
- **If you want to monetize or share data externally** while maintaining compliance (especially with time-series), **Syntho** highlights data marketplaces and robust collaboration.
- **For organizations seeking a step-by-step adoption program** with large-scale BFSI references, **Hazy** provides a high-touch, outcome-driven service (recently fortified by SAS acquisition).
- **When improving data quality for better AI outcomes** is top priority—including auto-profiling, rebalancing, bias mitigation—**YData** offers a data-centric AI toolset well-suited to refining datasets for ML.

Every vendor here supports privacy frameworks (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA) and uses generative approaches to produce synthetic or anonymized data. The best choice depends on the scale of your data operations, your regulatory context, how much developer tooling you need, and whether you’re primarily solving for dev/test usage, analytics, monetization, or large-scale AI/ML training.
