## Question

What can you tell me about the methods this company uses to generate synthetic data off of tabular data?

## Response

Statice employs several advanced methods to generate synthetic data from tabular data:

## Deep Learning Approaches

Statice utilizes deep learning models that have proven effective for synthetic data generation:

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Statice implements GAN-based approaches, which have been successful in generating synthetic tabular data[1][3].

- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: The company also uses VAE-based methods, particularly Tabular Variational Autoencoders (TVAE), which have shown strong performance for tabular data synthesis[1][3].

## Traditional Methods

In addition to deep learning techniques, Statice incorporates more traditional approaches:

- **Gaussian Copula**: This method is used to model the dependencies between variables in the tabular data[3].

## Hybrid Approach

Statice employs a hybrid approach to synthetic data generation:

- The software breaks down the data into groups and tackles each group with the most effective model for its characteristics[5].
- It then iterates over all parts while explicitly maintaining conditional dependencies, allowing for reassembly of the groups on the synthetic data side[5].

## Key Features

Statice's synthetic data generation process aims to maintain important statistical properties of the original data, including:

- Marginal distributions
- Conditional distributions
- Aggregated statistics
- Date and time distributions
- Pairwise dependencies (e.g., correlations and mutual information)[5]

By combining these methods and approaches, Statice's software provides a robust solution for generating high-quality synthetic tabular data that preserves the statistical properties and structure of the original dataset while ensuring privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.
