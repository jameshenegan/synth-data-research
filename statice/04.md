## Question

Is this company able to generate synthetic data based off of unstructed data (e.g., PDF files, Word Documents)

## Response

Based on the available information, there is no clear evidence that Statice is able to generate synthetic data from unstructured data sources like PDF files or Word documents. The search results and previous information about Statice primarily focus on their capabilities in generating synthetic data from structured, tabular datasets.

Statice's core offerings and technologies are centered around:

1. Generating privacy-preserving synthetic data from tabular datasets
2. Using advanced machine learning techniques for data anonymization
3. Preserving statistical properties and data utility of structured data

The company's expertise appears to lie in handling sensitive information from industries like finance, insurance, and healthcare, which typically deal with structured data formats.

While some companies in the synthetic data space are exploring unstructured data synthesis, the search results do not provide any indication that Statice has expanded its capabilities to include unstructured data sources like PDFs or Word documents. If you require synthetic data generation from unstructured sources, you may need to explore other specialized solutions or contact Statice directly to inquire about any recent developments in this area.
