## Question

Do you have any information on the pricing plans provided by this company?

## Response

Unfortunately, I do not have specific information about Statice's pricing plans. The search results do not provide detailed pricing information for Statice's synthetic data generation solutions.

While some sources mention that Statice offers pricing plans, the exact details are not publicly available. It's common for enterprise software companies like Statice to use custom pricing models based on factors like usage volume, features required, and implementation needs.

If you need accurate pricing information for Statice's offerings, I recommend contacting the company directly to request a custom quote tailored to your specific requirements. Enterprise software pricing often involves discussions with sales representatives to determine the most suitable package for a given organization's needs.
