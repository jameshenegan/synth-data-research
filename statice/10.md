## Question

What can you tell me about which companies or organizations use this company to produce synthetic data?

## Response

Based on the available information, several notable companies and organizations have used Statice for synthetic data generation:

1. PwC Germany: PwC incubated Statice's synthetic data solution to support internal operations and external advisory requirements. PwC Germany's Chief Data Officer, Marcus Hartmann, mentioned that Statice's technology changed how they drive digital transformation for their clients.

2. Financial institutions: While specific names are not provided, the search results indicate that Statice has expertise in serving the financial industry, particularly for data analysis and compliance purposes.

3. Insurance companies: Statice's solutions are mentioned as being applicable to the insurance industry, though no specific clients are named.

4. Healthcare organizations: The company's synthetic data generation capabilities are noted to be valuable for the healthcare sector, but no particular healthcare clients are identified.

5. Enterprises dealing with sensitive data: The search results suggest that various enterprises across industries use Statice's platform to gain access to sensitive data by creating artificial datasets that maintain statistical properties of the original data.

It's worth noting that while these industries and general types of organizations are mentioned as users of Statice's technology, the search results do not provide a comprehensive list of specific client names. This is common in the B2B software industry, where client relationships are often kept confidential. The acquisition of Statice by Anonos in November 2022 may have also impacted its client base and how that information is shared publicly.
