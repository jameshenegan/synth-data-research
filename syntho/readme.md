## Question

Is this company able to generate synthetic data based off of unstructed data (e.g., PDF files, Word Documents)

## Response

Based on the available information, Syntho does not appear to offer capabilities for generating synthetic data from unstructured data sources like PDF files or Word documents. The company's primary focus is on generating synthetic data from structured, tabular data sources.

Syntho's platform is designed to work with:

- Structured data formatted in tables (categorical, numerical, etc.)
- Large datasets and databases
- Geographic location data
- Time series data
- Multi-table databases
- Open text data within tabular structures

While Syntho can handle some forms of text data, it is specifically mentioned in the context of tabular data structures, not unstructured document formats like PDFs or Word files[4].

It's worth noting that other companies in the synthetic data space, such as Tonic.ai, do offer solutions for handling unstructured data in documents. For example, Tonic Textual can process PDF and Word documents to identify and redact sensitive information or replace it with synthetic data[1]. However, this capability is not mentioned for Syntho in the provided search results.

If handling unstructured data from documents is a specific requirement, it would be advisable to explore other solutions or contact Syntho directly to inquire about any recent developments or plans for supporting such features in the future.
