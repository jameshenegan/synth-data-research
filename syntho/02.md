## Question

Do you have any information on the pricing plans provided by this company?

## Response

Syntho offers a transparent, feature-based pricing model for its synthetic data generation platform. Here are the key points about Syntho's pricing:

1. Subscription-based model: Syntho operates on a subscription basis, providing unlimited data generation for a fixed price[1].

2. Feature-based pricing: The pricing is tailored to the features needed by the customer, rather than the volume of data produced[1][3].

3. No consumption charges: Syntho does not impose consumption-based charges, meaning users can generate as much synthetic data as they need without incurring additional costs[1][3].

4. Customized pricing: The company appears to offer customized pricing plans based on the specific needs and requirements of each client. Potential customers are encouraged to contact Syntho directly for detailed pricing information[3].

5. Deployment options: Pricing may vary depending on the deployment option chosen, as Syntho can be deployed on-premise, in private clouds, or in Syntho's own cloud environment[3].

It's important to note that specific pricing details are not publicly available on Syntho's website. To obtain accurate and up-to-date pricing information, interested parties should contact Syntho directly or request a product demo, which would likely include a discussion of pricing options tailored to their needs[5].
