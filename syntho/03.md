## Question

Is this company able to generate synthetic data based off of tabular data?

## Response

Yes, Syntho is capable of generating synthetic data based on tabular data. The company's core technology, the Syntho Engine, is specifically designed to support various forms of tabular data[1]. Here are some key points about Syntho's tabular data capabilities:

## Tabular Data Support

- Syntho can handle any form of tabular data, which is typically organized in rows and columns[1].
- The platform supports complex data types within tabular structures[1].

## Specific Tabular Data Types

Syntho's synthetic data generation capabilities extend to several specific types of tabular data:

- Time series data for simulating time-based patterns[1]
- Multi-table datasets and databases, preserving complex database structures[1]
- Data in any language (e.g., Dutch, English)[1]
- Data using various alphabets (e.g., English, Chinese, Japanese)[1]
- Geographic location data, such as GPS coordinates[6]

## Advanced Features

Syntho's platform offers several advanced features for handling tabular data:

- Automatic detection of data types, schemas, and formats to maximize data accuracy[1]
- Preservation of referential integrity in multi-table databases[1]
- Comprehensive table and column operations, allowing users to synthesize, duplicate, or exclude specific tables or columns[1]

## AI-Powered Generation

Syntho employs AI-powered generation techniques for creating synthetic tabular data:

- The platform uses generative AI models to preserve relationships and patterns in the original dataset[4].
- For time series or longitudinal data, Syntho has developed a sequence model to maintain sequential information across multiple observations[4].

In summary, Syntho is well-equipped to generate high-quality synthetic data based on various types of tabular data, offering a range of features to ensure accuracy and utility of the synthetic datasets.
