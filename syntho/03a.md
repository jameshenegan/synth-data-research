## Question

What can you tell me about the methods this company uses to generate synthetic data off of tabular data?

## Response

Syntho employs advanced AI-powered techniques to generate synthetic data from tabular data sources. The company's approach involves several key methods and features:

## AI-Generated Synthetic Data

Syntho uses generative AI models to create synthetic data that preserves the relationships and patterns found in the original dataset[1][5]. This approach allows for the generation of high-quality synthetic data that closely mimics real-world tabular data.

## Automatic Data Type Detection

The Syntho Engine automatically detects data types, schemas, and formats to maximize data accuracy[5]. This feature ensures that the synthetic data maintains the structure and characteristics of the original tabular data.

## Support for Complex Data Types

Syntho's platform can handle various forms of tabular data, including:

- Time series data
- Multi-table datasets and databases
- Data in any language and alphabet
- Geographic location data[5]

## Sequence Modeling

For time series or longitudinal data, Syntho has developed a sequence model to maintain sequential information across multiple observations[2]. This is particularly useful for datasets that contain temporal or ordered information.

## Preservation of Referential Integrity

In multi-table databases, Syntho automatically infers and generates primary and foreign keys to preserve referential integrity[5]. This ensures that the relationships between tables are maintained in the synthetic data.

## Comprehensive Table and Column Operations

The platform allows users to synthesize, duplicate, or exclude specific tables or columns, providing flexibility in configuring the synthetic data generation process[5].

## Scalability

Syntho's platform is optimized to minimize computational requirements while maintaining data accuracy. It supports auto-scaling for synthesizing large databases[5].

By combining these methods, Syntho offers a sophisticated approach to generating synthetic tabular data that closely resembles the original data while ensuring privacy and maintaining data utility for analytics and machine learning tasks.
