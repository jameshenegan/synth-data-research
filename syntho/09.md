## Question

Do you know where the company is located? Are they based in the United States?

## Response

Syntho is not based in the United States. The company is headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Specifically, their headquarters are located at:

John M. Keynesplein 12 B Building, location B2
Amsterdam, 1066 EP
Netherlands

It's important to note that this Syntho, founded in 2020 and specializing in AI-generated synthetic data, is different from Syntho Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which is a separate company based in Farmingdale, New York, USA. The Syntho we're discussing is the Dutch technology company focused on synthetic data generation, not the pharmaceutical manufacturer.
