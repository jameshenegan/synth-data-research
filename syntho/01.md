## Key Features and Solutions

Syntho offers an all-in-one platform with three main solutions:

1. **AI-Generated Synthetic Data for Analytics**: This solution mimics the statistical patterns, relationships, and characteristics of original data using artificial intelligence algorithms[3]. The synthetic data can be used for analytics and AI modeling while preserving privacy[1].

Syntho's core technology, the **Syntho Engine**, supports various data types and offers deployment flexibility:

- On-premise
- Any private cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.)
- Syntho cloud
- Other environments[6]

The platform can be deployed as a Docker container or Python package in secure IT environments[9].

## Industries and Use Cases

Syntho primarily serves sectors that handle privacy-sensitive data, including:

- Healthcare
- Finance
- Public organizations
- Telecommunications[3][9]

Common use cases include product demonstrations, data monetization, and facilitating data science projects[8].

## Pricing and Business Model

Syntho operates on a subscription-based model, offering unlimited data generation for a fixed price[5]. The pricing is tailored to the features needed rather than the volume of data produced[6].

## Recognition and Partnerships

Syntho has gained recognition in the industry:
