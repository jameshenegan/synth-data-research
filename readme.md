# Intro/Context

My manager recently asked me to investigate some companies that provide solutions for generating synthetic data. This presentation does **not** aim to recommend a single vendor or approach. Instead, its primary goal is to offer an **objective overview** of the current synthetic data landscape, highlighting the key methods, use cases, and considerations.

## Definition of Synthetic Data and Survey of Related Concepts

### Definition of Synthetic Data

Synthetic data is artificially generated data that mirrors the statistical properties, patterns, and structures of real-world data without containing any actual personal or identifying information. It is produced through generative AI models, algorithms, or other statistical methods that learn from sample datasets to replicate their correlations and distributions. The result is data that “looks and feels” like the original while ensuring privacy, making it an ideal substitute when concerns about data sensitivity, legal restrictions, or personal information protection arise.

### Relationship to Data Anonymization

**Synthetic Data as Anonymization**  
Synthetic data is one approach to data anonymization, complementing other techniques such as data masking. Some of the vendors we reviewed also offer these alternative methods.

### Not the Same as Simulated Data

Some experts classify “simulated data”—which is created entirely from scratch without referencing a real dataset—as a subset of synthetic data. Others draw a clear distinction, arguing that synthetic data should retain statistical properties from **actual** data. In this presentation, we focus on **synthetic data derived from real datasets** and exclude purely simulated data from our scope.

# Brief History and Evolution of Methods

**Key Milestones in Synthetic Data**

1. **Foundational Multiple Imputation (1978 & 1987)**

   - **Donald Rubin** develops multiple imputation to handle missing data.
   - This framework later inspires the idea of using synthetic data for privacy.

2. **Fully vs. Partially Synthetic Data (1993)**

   - **Rubin** formally proposes generating _fully_ synthetic data—impute _all_ records and variables to protect confidentiality.
   - **Little** introduces a _partially_ synthetic approach—only synthesize the most sensitive records or fields.

3. **Differential Privacy (2006)**

   - **Dwork et al.** redefine privacy by focusing on how data are released (the _mechanism_) rather than the released data itself.
   - This shift opens the door to _differentially private synthetic data_ methods.

4. **GANs Enter the Scene (2014)**

   - **Goodfellow et al.** propose Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create synthetic images.
   - Researchers soon adapt GANs to generate _tabular (micro) data_, leading to advanced privacy-preserving data synthesis techniques.

5. **Modern Developments**
   - Integration of **DP** with GANs and other machine learning models (e.g., Bayesian networks, autoencoders) improves both _utility_ and _privacy_.
   - Statistical agencies and industry increasingly adopt synthetic data to protect confidentiality while allowing broader data access.

# Use Cases and Success Stories

# Use Cases and Success Stories

## 1. Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing

**Primary Challenge:** Organizations often need to share data internally or with external partners (e.g., vendors, research institutions) but face legal or regulatory obstacles (such as GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA) that restrict the use of real personal data. Traditional anonymization techniques can degrade data quality or still carry risks of re-identification.

**How Synthetic Data Helps:**

- **Safe Collaboration:** Synthetic data retains the statistical properties of real data but contains no personally identifiable information (PII). As a result, teams can freely share it for analytical, testing, or collaborative projects without compromising privacy.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Generating synthetic data ensures adherence to data protection regulations, since it is considered non-personal. This removes the need to secure additional data-sharing consents or pass lengthy governance approvals.
- **Accelerated Partnerships:** By providing synthetic datasets to prospective suppliers, data-sharing consortia, and academic researchers, organizations can speed up vendor evaluations or co-development projects.

**Real-World Examples:**

- **Banking and Financial Services:** Banks create synthetic customer transaction data for fraud analysis or credit scoring prototypes. This allows them to compare different analytic solutions safely.
- **Healthcare:** Hospitals generate synthetic patient records to enable research collaborations without exposing sensitive personal health information.
- **Insurance:** Insurers share synthetic claims data with insurtech startups to test new underwriting or fraud detection methods.

## 2. System and Software Testing

**Primary Challenge:** Developers require realistic datasets to test new software features, conduct user acceptance testing (UAT), or ensure systems perform correctly at scale. But using production data can risk privacy breaches, and purely fabricated “mock” data often lacks the complexity of real-world scenarios.

**How Synthetic Data Helps:**

- **Realistic Complexity:** Advanced synthetic data generation captures correlations, distributions, and edge cases present in original datasets. This realism improves the accuracy of performance tests and bug detection.
- **Agile Delivery:** Synthetic data removes the wait time for clearing production data usage. It can be refreshed automatically to mirror changes in live systems, enabling continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) workflows.
- **Edge Case Simulation:** Rare events can be artificially injected at higher frequency in synthetic data, enabling robust stress testing or anomaly detection.

**Real-World Examples:**

- **Telecommunications:** Synthetic logs of network traffic help engineers simulate network outages or service disruptions, verifying that incident response protocols function effectively.

## 3. Data Augmentation for Machine Learning

**Primary Challenge:** Machine learning and AI initiatives often suffer from data scarcity, lack of variety, or underrepresentation of certain classes (like fraud transactions or rare diseases). Collecting sufficient labeled data is expensive and time-consuming.

**How Synthetic Data Helps:**

- **Increased Training Samples:** Synthetic data can expand datasets substantially, helping ML models better generalize. For instance, generating additional examples for underrepresented classes reduces class imbalance and can improve predictive accuracy.
- **Cost-Effective Labeling:** In fields such as computer vision or natural language processing, manually labeled data is expensive. Synthetic data can come pre-labeled (for example, from simulated environments) and fill these gaps more affordably.
- **De-Biasing:** If real-world data is biased—for instance, underrepresenting certain demographic groups—synthetic data can systematically create balanced distributions, thus reducing discriminatory outcomes.

**Real-World Examples:**

- **Fraud Detection:** Banks and payment services generate additional fraudulent transaction patterns to ensure ML models encounter enough examples to learn nuanced signals of criminal activity.
- **Healthcare Diagnosis:** Researchers create synthetic MRI or CT images to boost the number of rare pathology cases available for training radiology AI systems.
- **Autonomous Vehicles:** Companies like those in robotics or transportation rely on simulated driving scenarios. Environments like self-driving simulators produce labeled images to train perception and navigation algorithms.

---

## 4. De-biasing and Fairness

**Primary Challenge:** Historical or real datasets might be skewed—either by underrepresenting minority groups or reflecting past discriminatory practices. Biased data can lead to biased predictions or recommendations in AI systems.

**How Synthetic Data Helps:**

- **Removing Sensitive Attributes:** Synthetic data generation algorithms can systematically remove or rebalance sensitive demographic attributes (e.g., race, gender).
- **What-If Scenarios:** Organizations can use synthetic data with adjusted causal factors or distributions to simulate hypothetical worlds—like a “fairer” environment with equal representation—and observe how models might behave.

**Real-World Examples:**

- **Financial Lending:** Synthetic data can remove historically embedded biases in loan approvals, creating a training set that ensures fairer credit underwriting.
- **Human Resources:** People analytics teams use synthetic data to assess if promotion pathways are equally accessible to employees of all backgrounds, then train decision-support tools on unbiased datasets.

---

## 5. Rapid Prototyping and Product Development

**Primary Challenge:** Long lead times for accessing or processing regulated data slow innovation. Often, product teams must wait months for data provisioning approvals, losing market opportunities.

**How Synthetic Data Helps:**

- **Faster Iterations:** Data scientists and product managers can rapidly experiment with new features using synthetic data, refine solutions, and only integrate real data at later stages.
- **Scalable Testing Environments:** Synthetic data can be scaled to large volumes to stress test new cloud-based or on-premises solutions without incurring overhead for real data orchestration.
- **Early Feasibility Studies:** Allows teams to run early proof-of-concept models without navigating multiple sign-offs for privacy compliance.

**Real-World Examples:**

- **Fintech Startups:** Quickly build and validate new personal finance tools in a synthetic data sandbox to confirm viability before deploying real user data.
- **Market Research:** Firms can show potential customers or partners product demos powered by synthetic data that mirrors actual usage patterns—without revealing sensitive user information.

---

## 6. Data Monetization and Sharing

**Primary Challenge:** Organizations may have rich data sets that could be packaged into new products or services (for instance, sold to partners or used to generate insights for third parties). However, direct sharing of real data may violate privacy laws or confidentiality agreements.

**How Synthetic Data Helps:**

- **Secure Data Products:** Convert real data into synthetic datasets that preserve analytic value—trends, correlations, anomalies—then license these data products with minimal privacy risk.
- **Global Collaboration:** Overcome cross-border data transfer constraints by distributing synthetic data to international partners without violating regulations like GDPR or other data localization laws.
- **Commercial Opportunities:** Telcos, banks, or retailers can open new revenue streams by providing synthetic insights to advertisers, city planners, or market research agencies.

**Real-World Examples:**

- **Telecommunications:** Mobile usage data can be synthesized to help municipal authorities improve traffic flows or plan infrastructure, without exposing individual subscriber details.
- **Automotive Lending:** Synthetic credit records can be sold to analytics partners who refine pricing models or gather market intelligence.
- **Retail Loyalty Data:** A retailer synthesizes in-store and online purchase data to offer predictive analytics to manufacturers, all without sharing identifiable shopper behaviors.

---

## 7. Risk Management and Rare Event Simulation

**Primary Challenge:** Certain industries (e.g., insurance, finance) must accurately model rare but high-impact scenarios—like natural disasters, major financial crashes, or pandemic-related claims. Gathering enough real data on these rare events is inherently difficult.

**How Synthetic Data Helps:**

- **Scenario Generation:** Synthetic data can be used to model historically rare or “what-if” events with controlled distributions.
- **Stress Testing:** Banks or insurers run stress tests on capital requirements using artificially inflated or adjusted data about extreme events, ensuring models and strategies are robust to outliers.
- **Fraud and Intrusion Detection:** Generate high volumes of malicious attack patterns to better train cybersecurity or fraud systems that ordinarily might see only small volumes of real-world examples.

**Real-World Examples:**

- **Insurance:** Synthetic claims data for extreme weather events helps refine underwriting policies and risk pricing for catastrophic scenarios.
- **Cybersecurity:** Synthetic log data with embedded attack signatures is invaluable for training or testing intrusion detection tools without risking real network logs.

---

## 8. Regulatory Compliance and Auditing

**Primary Challenge:** Compliance teams and auditors need to examine data for risk assessments or internal reviews, but direct access to sensitive data can be restricted, time-consuming, and potentially non-compliant if not carefully managed.

**How Synthetic Data Helps:**

- **Streamlined Audits:** Auditors can review synthetic datasets that mirror real transaction patterns or employee activity while ensuring no actual personal data is exposed.
- **Reduced Data Exposure:** Minimizes risk associated with internal handling of large volumes of personal data, as synthetic data mitigates re-identification threats.
- **Long-Term Retention:** In industries where regulations mandate the deletion of personal information after certain retention periods, synthetic copies can be archived indefinitely for analysis and compliance checks.

**Real-World Examples:**

- **Banking:** Internal compliance teams use synthetic financial transactions to validate anti-money-laundering (AML) processes without direct exposure to actual customers’ details.
- **Healthcare and Pharma:** Synthetic patient data can be stored and studied long term, ensuring compliance with HIPAA or other privacy regulations even when real patient records must be destroyed after a set period.

# The Holy Grail: What Does the Ideal Solution Look Like?

When evaluating synthetic data solutions, four key attributes often come into play:

1. **Syntactical Accuracy**  
   The generated data should be valid and realistic according to domain constraints (e.g., proper time-series ordering, valid postal codes).

2. **Privacy**  
   The method should prevent re-identification, ideally using formal privacy frameworks such as differential privacy.

3. **Statistical Accuracy**  
   Relevant distributions and correlations should align with the real dataset to the extent needed by the use case.

4. **Efficiency**  
   Algorithms must handle high-dimensional data and produce synthetic datasets at scale without excessive computational overhead.

It can be helpful to group these considerations into **fidelity, utility, and privacy**:

1. **Utility**

   - How well does synthetic data replicate real data for specific tasks (e.g., machine learning models)?
   - Often tested via “Train on Synthetic, Test on Real” (TSTR).

2. **Fidelity**

   - Measures how closely synthetic data matches the real data’s distributions and structure.
   - In some cases, preserving all correlations can risk privacy or replicate existing biases.

3. **Privacy**
   - Focuses on limiting how much information about real individuals might be inferred.
   - Higher fidelity tends to lower privacy, so solutions must balance these two.

# Challenges in Finding the Holy Grail

- **Trade-offs**: There is no single method that guarantees perfect fidelity and strong privacy in all scenarios.
- **Prioritization**: Generators must decide which correlations are most important for the intended use.
- **Partial Preservation**: Preserving “most” relationships may suffice, but requires careful assessment of what might be lost or disclosed.

- **For organizations seeking a step-by-step adoption program** with large-scale BFSI references, **Hazy** provides a high-touch, outcome-driven service (recently fortified by SAS acquisition).
- **When improving data quality for better AI outcomes** is top priority—including auto-profiling, rebalancing, bias mitigation—**YData** offers a data-centric AI toolset well-suited to refining datasets for ML.

Every vendor here supports privacy frameworks (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA) and uses generative approaches to produce synthetic or anonymized data. The best choice depends on the scale of your data operations, your regulatory context, how much developer tooling you need, and whether you’re primarily solving for dev/test usage, analytics, monetization, or large-scale AI/ML training.

# Evaluation Framework

## 2. Create an Evaluation Framework

Use the following categories to structure your vendor comparisons:

### A. Data Fidelity & Utility

- **Statistical Similarity**:
  - Does the synthetic data preserve important statistical properties (distributions, correlations, outliers) of the real data?
  - Do they offer metrics (e.g., Jensen–Shannon divergence, correlation comparisons, feature importance tests) to gauge fidelity?
- **Model Performance**:
  - How do machine learning models trained on (or tested with) the synthetic data perform compared to those trained on real data?
  - Request or conduct a proof-of-concept (PoC) to measure any drop-off in model accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

### B. Privacy & Security

- **Privacy Guarantees**:
  - Does the tool provide formal privacy measures (e.g., differential privacy)?
  - How do they prevent re-identification or leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI)?
- **Data Handling**:
  - For on-prem solutions, confirm that no real data is ever sent to the vendor or a third-party cloud environment.
  - If there’s a “phoning home” or usage-metering requirement, what exactly is transmitted? Is it encrypted? Is it anonymized?
- **Certifications & Compliance**:
  - Does the vendor have relevant certifications (e.g., SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001)?
  - Are they able to provide documentation on HIPAA or other compliance frameworks?

### C. Deployment & Integration

- **Deployment Options**:
  - On-prem software, containerized solution (Docker, Kubernetes), private cloud, or fully managed SaaS?
  - How do these match your IT and security constraints?
- **Integration with Existing Workflows**:
  - Can the tool connect to your data sources (databases, data lakes, etc.) easily?
  - Does it offer APIs or SDKs for automation within your existing data pipelines (e.g., Python libraries, CLI tools, etc.)?
- **Performance & Scalability**:
  - How quickly can it generate synthetic data at the volume you need?
  - Does it handle large, high-dimensional datasets efficiently?

### D. Usability & Features

- **User Interface & Ease of Use**:
  - Is there a GUI for non-technical users?
  - Are there advanced configuration options for data scientists who need fine control?
- **Data Exploration & Visualization Tools**:
  - Does the platform help you compare real vs. synthetic distributions visually?
  - Does it offer data profiling or summary statistics?
- **Specialized Features**:
  - Time-series synthesis, text synthesis, image synthesis, or domain-specific transformations for insurance data (e.g., claim sequences).

### E. Vendor Expertise & Support

- **Domain Knowledge**:
  - Has the vendor worked with insurance companies before?
  - Can they share case studies or references?
- **Support & Training**:
  - Do they offer implementation guidance, training sessions, or dedicated support?
  - Are there professional services to help with complex setups or custom needs?
- **Roadmap & Innovation**:
  - Does the vendor have a clear product roadmap?
  - Are they actively investing in R&D to improve synthetic data fidelity and privacy techniques?

### F. Pricing & Licensing

- **Licensing Model**:
  - Usage-based, seat-based, capacity-based, or enterprise license?
  - What are the potential overage costs if you exceed usage?
- **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**:
  - Implementation, configuration, hardware, ongoing support, etc.
  - Are there hidden costs for feature add-ons, advanced modules, or premium support?

# Conclusion

1. **Significant Potential**

   - **Privacy**: Well-designed synthetic data allows safe data sharing.
   - **Fairness**: Can reduce biases by balancing underrepresented groups.
   - **Data Augmentation**: Expands datasets for model training.
   - **Project Acceleration**: Enables faster prototyping and testing.

2. **Not Automatically Private**

   - Generating synthetic data does not guarantee anonymity.
   - Formal methods (e.g., differential privacy) are often needed to prevent re-identification.

3. **No Perfect Substitute for Real Data**

   - Synthetic data inevitably shifts certain features, affecting some use cases.
   - Critical or high-stakes applications typically require validation with real data.

4. **Difficulties with Outliers and Rare Events**

   - Extreme or uncommon data points are challenging to handle privately.
   - Solutions may omit them (hurting fidelity) or inadvertently expose them (hurting privacy).

5. **Challenges in Privacy Evaluation**

   - True privacy depends on how data is generated, not just on the dataset itself.
   - Over-reliance on simple checks can yield false confidence.

6. **Complexity of Black-Box Models**

   - Deep generative models can produce realistic data but are often opaque.
   - This can complicate audits or explainability for regulators or stakeholders.

7. **Beyond Privacy**
   - Synthetic data can address fairness, bias reduction, and robustness.
   - Ongoing research will clarify both benefits and risks in these domains.
